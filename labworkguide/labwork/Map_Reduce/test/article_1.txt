I've translated a popular Russian joke to English , wanna hear you reaction )) A young boy says to his father "Dad, our math teacher is asking to see you."

"What happened?" The father asks.

"Well, she asks me, 'how much is 7 * 9?' I answer '63' , then she asks, 'and 9 * 7?' so I asked 'what's the fucking difference?' "

"Indeed, what is the difference?" asks the father. ''Sure, I'll go.''

The next day, the boy comes home from school "Dad, have you gone by the school?" He asks.

"Not yet."

"Well when you do, come and see the gym teacher also."

"Why?" asks the father.

The boy explains, "Well we had a gym class today, and he asked me to raise my left arm, I did. Then my right arm, I also raised it. Then he asked me to lift my right leg, so I did. 'Now,' he says, 'lift your left leg,' so I asked 'What, am I suppose to stand on my cock!?'"

"Exactly," says the father. "Alright, I'll come."

The next day, the boy asks his father "Did you go to the school?"

"No, not yet."

"Don't bother, I got expelled."

Surprised, the father asks "Why did you get expelled?"

"Well, they summoned me to the principal's office, and sitting there were the math teacher, the gym teacher, and the art teacher."

"The fuck was the art teacher doing there!?" asks the father.

"That's what I said" replied the boy.

A rugby player was hurt very badly during a scrum and he had both of his ears ripped off... Since he was permanently disfigured, he decided to give up playing rugby for good.

 His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money went his way.

One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear business. 

He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line, realized that he knew nothing about business. 

He decided to employ someone to run the shop.

The next day he set up three interviews. 

The first guy was great. 

He knew everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. 

At the end of the interview, the former rugby player asked him, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

And the man replied, “Why, yes, I couldn’t help noticing you have no ears.” 

The rugby player got angry and threw him out.

The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. 

He asked her the same question, “Do you notice anything different about me?”

She replied: “Well, you have no ears.” 

He got upset again and showed her the door.

The third and last interview was with the best of the three. 

He was a very young man fresh out of college. 

He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all about the sportswear business.

The rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question: “Do you notice anything different about me?”

To his surprise the young man answered: “Yes, you wear contact lenses.”

The former rugby player was shocked, and said, “What an incredibly observant young man you are. How in the world did you know that?”

The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, “Well, it’s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears!”

She opened it, slammed it shut, and stormed back in the house.

A little later she came out of her house and again went to the mail box and again opened it, then slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went.

As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever.

Puzzled by her actions the man asked her, “Is something wrong?”

To which she replied, “There certainly is! My stupid computer keeps giving me a message saying, “YOU’VE GOT MAIL!”

So the woman poked her ankle and screamed of pain. Then she poked her knee and yelled OW. She poked her forehead and screamed again.

She was about to continue when the doctor said, “That’s enough, let me think this over.” He thought for about a minute and said “I think I know what your problem is. You broke your finger.”

Man gets lost in the desert. He has no compass and he has lost his sense of direction. 

Suddenly he sees a caravan on the horizon. He jumps, shouts and waves his arms to get their attention, and, oh joy, they notice him and move in his direction. 

But his happiness is short lived, as the travelers turn out to be mean and sadistic. They rough him up, and then bury him in the sand with only his head above the surface.

He grimly contemplates whether he'll die of sun stroke, dehydration or from attack of some savage beast. Suddenly, a lone traveler appears in front of him and inquires about his predicament. 

**You see, first I got lost, without a compass and provisions. Then I encountered these sadists, who beaten me up, bury me this way and left... Can you believe such behavior?**

**Tsk, tsk...** says the traveler, as he puts his foot on top of the man's head and pushes it under the surface **Amateurs, such amateurs...**

Valentine's day fights My wife sat down on the couch  next to me as I was flipping channels.
She asked, 'What's on TV?'  
I said, 'Dust.' And then the fight started....

My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary. She said, 'I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 100 in about 3 seconds.'

I bought her a weighing scale. And then the fight started....
 

When I got home last night, my wife demanded that I take her someplace expensive.

So I took her to a petrol pump. And then the fight started....
  
My wife was standing & looking in the bedroom mirror. She was not happy with what she saw and said to me, 'I feel horrible. I look old, fat and ugly. I really need you to give me a compliment."

I replied, "Your eyesight is perfect." And then the fight started....
  
I asked my wife, "Where do you want to go for our anniversary?"
It warmed my heart to see her face melt in sweet appreciation.
"Somewhere I've not been in a long time."

So I took her to my parents' house. And then the fight started....

So Seamus and Mary are an elderly couple And they are very private. Ever since they were young they wouldn't talk about sex publicly, but instead developed a code phrase: Doing a load of laundry. 

One night they are out at the pub, having a couple drinks, and Seamus turns to Mary and asks "D'ya fancy going home and doing a load of laundry?"

Mary looks at Seamus and says "you know that sounds lovely. Let's do."

They finish their drinks and head home together. 

At home they are sitting in front of the fire, Seamus smoking his pipe and Mary with her knitting. Seamus asks "Mary? D'ya still fancy that load of laundry?" 

Mary looks at Seamus and says "aye I do, I really do. Let me just finish my knitting."

So Seamus gets up and heads to the bed room. 

Mary keeps knitting and forgets all about Seamus. 

After an hour she realizes she forgot and jumps up and rushes to the bedroom. "Seamus?" Mary asks, "D'ya still fancy doing a load of laundry?"

From under the covers Seamus replies 

"Y'know, Mary, it was a small load, so I did it by hand."

Why do you ask? A young Native American boy goes up to the chief of his tribe and asks "Chief, how did we get our names?"

There's a bizarre black-market concession stand in North America which sells only human body parts Customers who wish to purchase an item must use code-phrases to avoid the authorities' suspicion.

One night a blind man stops by the stand.

"What would you like to purchase today?" asks the cashier.

"Oh, nothing" the blind man says, "I was just *looking* around!"

An few hours later, a deaf man approaches the stand.  The cashier realizes he can't hear him, and uses sign-language to ask what he'd like to purchase.

"Well, I *heard* you guys are having a sale!" the deaf man states with a wink and a nudge.

Finally, just before that night's closing time, a muscular man with no apparent disability walks up to the stand.  The cashier asks what he'd like to purchase.

"I don't know ... I heard you guys sold *cherries*!" the man states with a look of subtle expectation.

The cashier, despite going through his mental checklist of code-phrases, has no idea what he wants.

"I'm sorry, we've sold-out on that item." the cashier says with a puzzled stare.

"Ah *motherfucking* christ!" the man screams in pseudo-frustration.  However, the cashier just stands there with an agitated face.

The customer, realizing his attempts aren't getting through to the employee, tries a different approach.

"Well, that's a darn shame!" he continues. 
"And I travelled across the entire *count-*" 

The man coughs.

"-ry to get here!"

A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years He breaks into a house to look for money and guns and finds a young couple in bed.

He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:

"Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you."

To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!"

A flood warning is given, but the local priest decides to stay... The water level starts rising, but he has faith that God will save him. As the water is up to his knees, an old man in a rowboat sails up to him.

"Hey," he says. "Need a lift?"

The priest shakes his head. "No thank you, I have faith that the lord will save me. Use your boat to find those more in need."

The rowboat heads off, and soon the water is up to the priest's chest.  A rescue boat loaded with supplies comes racing up to him.

"Grab my hand!" the captain yells. "We gotta get out of here!"

"No!" The priest yells. "There are others who need help. I assure you, the lord will save me!"

Reluctantly, the rescue boat rides off.

As the water continues to rise, the priest is forced to the roof of his house. A helicopter flies over to him and lowers a winch.

"Hold on!" Shouts the winchman as he holds out his hand.

But the priest again shakes his head. "No! The lord will save me! Go save someone else!"

Frustrated, the helicopter flies away. 

Sadly, the water becomes too much for the priest to deal with and he goes under.

He finds himself in heaven, absolutely stunned. After going through the pearly gates, he walks straight up to God himself.

"Lord," the priest says, "I spent my life devoted to you. I truly believed that you would protect me through the hardest times in my life. Yet when I needed you most, when my life was at stake, you weren't there for me!"

"What are you talking about?" God replies. "I sent two boats and a fucking helicopter!!"

Joe bought a gun . . . Joe bought a gun. He walked right into the sporting goods store, up to the gun counter, and picked out a semi-automatic .12 gauge shotgun with a box of buckshot shells. The entire process took no more than twenty minutes. 

Joe left town and drove for a couple hours before exiting the highway and driving down a winding county road for another ten minutes. Joe pulled into a service station and parked his car. He sat in his vehicle, loaded five shells into his new Benelli shotgun, and chambered in a shell.

Joe clicked off the safety and walked into the convenience store. There was no one in sight but the attendant behind the counter. Her name was Janice. She tried to run when she saw the shotgun but Joe shot her as she turned. She took some buckshot to the brain and died almost instantly.

Joe walked behind the counter, stepping carefully over Janice, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. "I've killed a lady. I'm robbing the store," Joe told the 911 operator. He then emptied the cash register, walked out to his vehicle, and drove away. 

A short ways down the road, Joe came upon another service station. He pulled in and exited his vehicle. The owner of the service station was a capable man named Bill. Bill saw the look in Joe's eyes when Joe approached the door of the service station, and he saw the gun in his hand. Bill was ready with his own shotgun by the time Joe raised his, and Bill pumped a slug into Joe's abdomen.

Bill immediately called for an ambulance and approached Joe with compassion. "Let me help you, son."

As Bill tended to Joe's wounds as best as he could, it became clear that Joe might not survive. Bill asked him, "Why did you do it, son? Why did you bring that damn gun into my store? I had to shoot you. What, were you going to rob me? Why?"

As the light of life flickered in Joe's eyes, with his dying breath he responded, "Damn it all. Shamu and Moby Dick put me up to it. They are waiting outside for me right now. I'm gonna go get them. Be right back, mister."

And with that, Joe died. Bill would go on to give a full account of Joe's actions and his last words to the police and to the press. Then, the following morning, the Sunday paper headline read,

"The Outlaw Joe Sees Whales"
My pal is a comedian. He woke me up late last night and asked if I could write a few gags for his set in a couple of days, because his mom just died and he was busy with her funeral. I agreed to help him out and asked if he had a topic in mind. 

He said, sorry, I'm too upset to be thinking about chocolate right now.

Looks like I'm going to need help.

Measurements A man and his wife were outside their house doing yardwork. The husband looked over at his wife bent over her flower bed and said "ya know honey, I never really noticed how big your ass is. Why, I bet it's just as wide as the range on the grill." To prove his point, the man went and grabbed the tape measure out of his toolbox. First he measured the width of the grill then his wife's bottom. "Yep, just as thought. It really is as big as the grill." The wife got offended and stormed back into the house.

Later that night, laying in bed, the husband started feeling frisky. He put his arm around hia wife and said "hey honey, what do ya say we fool around a little bit?". The wife turned to face him and said "Now why would I fire up this big ol' grill for one little weenie?".

An Engineer Goes to Hell An Engineer dies and goes to hell. He's hot and miserable, so he decides to take action. The A/C has been busted for a long time, so he fixes it. Things cool down quickly.

The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un jams it. People can get from place to place more easily.

The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the Satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels.

One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's going on?

The Devil replies, "Things are great down here since you sent us that engineer."

"What?? An engineer? I didn't send you one of those, that must have been a mistake. Send him back up right this minute."

The Devil responds, "No way! We are going to keep our engineer. We like this guy."

God demands, "If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!"

The Devil laughs. "Where are you going to get a lawyer?"

And the Chinese man says, "What are you even talking about, that was the Japanese, I'm Chinese." 

To which the Jewish man replies, "Chinese, Japanese, you all are the same to me." And he walks away. 

Well this upset the Chinese man a bit so he decided to get a few drinks in him to help him calm down and maybe forget about the incident altogether. 

And so the Chinese man proceeded to drink until the wedding was over and as he was walking out he saw the Jewish man who had upset him earlier and being as inebriated as he was he decided to say something. 

The Chinese man goes to Jewish man, "Hey Buddy, I just wanted to let you know that I still blame YOU for the Titanic." 

"The Titanic?" Said the Jewish man, "What are you even talking about, that was an iceberg?" 

And the Chinese man says with a smug smile on his face, "Goldberg, iceberg, you're all the same to me."

A Swede, an Icelander and a Norwegian end up shipwrecked on a deserted island. One day, as they are scouring the beaches for firewood, they come across an old oil lamp, washed ashore. The Swede picks it up and wipes it gently with his shirt sleeve, clearing the sand and the dirt. Out pops a spirit. The spirit says:

"I have been trapped inside that lamp for a millennium due to a magic spell. Finally I have been set free. As a token of my gratitude, I will grant you one wish each."

The Swede states that he is fed up with that little island and he would like to go back to Trelleborg. Poof, the Swede is gone. Next up is the Norwegian. He says: "I agree. I want to go home too, back to Narvik." Poof, the Norwegian vanishes. Now only the Icelander is left. After some pondering, he makes his wish. "It's too lonely out here all by myself. I want my friends back!"

One of the twins was hard of hearing and the other could hear quite well. 

The photographer asked them to sit on the sofa and the deaf one said to her twin, "WHAT DID HE SAY?" 

He said, "WE GOTTA SIT OVER THERE ON THE SOFA!" said the other. 

"Now get a little closer together," said the cameraman. 

Again, "WHAT DID HE SAY?" 

"HE SAYS SQUEEZE TOGETHER A LITTLE." So they wiggled up close to each other. 

"Just hold on for a bit longer, I've got to focus a little," said the photographer. 

Yet again, "WHAT DID HE SAY?" 

"HE SAYS HE'S GONNA FOCUS!" 

With a big grin the deaf twin shouted out, "OH MY GOD - BOTH OF US?"

Two men are sitting drinking at a bar At the top of the Empire State Building, when the first man turns to the other and says "You know, last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building, the winds around the building are so intense that by the time you fall to the 10th floor, they carry you around the building and back into a window". The bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping the bar.

The second guy says, "What, are you nuts? There's no way that could happen. "No, its true," the first man says. "Let me prove it to you." He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets toward the street below. As he nears the 10th floor, the high winds whip him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar.

He meets the second man, who looks quite astonished. "You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke." "No, I'll prove it again," says the first man as he jumps again. Just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it.
"Well, why not." the second guy says, "It works. I'll try it." He jumps over the balcony, plunges downward passes the 11th, 10th 9th, 8th, floors. . . . . and hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
Back upstairs the bartender turns to the other drinker and says, "You know Superman, you're a real jerk when you're drunk".

Putting it in. A married Irishman went into the confessional and said to his priest,

'I almost had an affair with another woman.'

The priest said, 'What do you mean, almost?'

The Irishman said, 'Well, we got undressed and rubbed together, but then I stopped.'

The priest said, 'Rubbing together is the same as putting it in.  You're not to see that woman again. For your penance, say five Hail Mary's and put $50 in the poor box.'

The Irishman left the confessional, said his prayers, and then walked over to the poor box.

He paused for a moment and then started to leave.

The priest, who was watching, quickly ran over to him saying, 'I saw that. You didn't put any money in the poor box!'

The Irishman replied, 'Yeah, but I rubbed the $50 on the box, and
according to you, that's the same as putting it in!'

Ravens and Crows A good friend told me a story once. When she was a kid her family would often go to zoos and museums while on vacation. They were in the aviary on one of those visits looking at birds. My friend saw a crow asked the zookeeper a question. 

"What's the difference between a raven and a crow?" 

The zookeeper looked at her, smiled and started to answer. 

"Have you ever heard of a pinion feather?" he said. "Pinions are the the feathers at the tip of a bird's wing that allows it to fly. They are also the ones that people will trim to prevent birds from flying away. Crows have 5 pinion feathers while ravens have 6. So, if you think about it, it's really just a matter of a pinion." 

To this day, my friend and her family don't know the real answer to "What's the difference between a crow and a raven?"  
A government man is walking his way to work... As he carries his heavy suitcase, a Russian woman comes up to him with a whiskey bottle in her hand and says, "I'll jerk your dick while you chug this, deal?"

The man, not even thinking about the situation, agrees instantly and they rush off to the restroom, find a stall, and start doing it. While being jerked, he caps of the whisky bottle and starts chugging. A moment after, he starts feeling funny and dozes off to sleep. He wakes up, unknown of the time that has passed, and looks down only to realize his pants and underwear is gone, including his suitcase.

Horrified, he runs out of the restroom, his thong going everywhere and 'bout, and yells,

 "Help! Help! I've been jacked!"

Aliens come to earth, and they're friendly! [NSFW] Aliens finally arrive on earth, and they're just as social as we are.  They meet with the human delegation and have a lovely chat, talking about how each species eats and sleeps and so on. "Really! you guys put food in your face hole and throw away any leftovers. We just lay on it and absorb what we need." Stuff like that.  The topic turns to procreation and both delegations admit they're curious and that a demonstration would be probably be best.  The aliens go first. One hops on another's head, starts spinning and after ten minutes or so a tiny new alien falls to the ground, dusts itself off and politely asks for sustenance.  Then it's our turn.  The two volunteers come out and after a couple minutes they've finished (at least one of them has).  The aliens stand there for a moment before one leans over and shyly and asks, "so, uh, where's the new human?" The humans reply, "oh, it'll be here in about 9 months." The alien asks "Then what was the rush at the end for?"

A Frenchman, an Italian and a Jewish man die and go to heaven.... An angel ushers the Frenchman into a room filled with every French delicacy imaginable and instructs him - you can eat whatever you want, but if you eat anything from this table, at 5:00 a boiling pot of French onion soup will be wheeled in and you're going in it. 

The Frenchman thinks for a moment and stands back in fear. 

An angel ushers the Italian into a room filled with every Italian delicacy imaginable and instructs him - you can eat whatever you want, but if you eat anything from this table, at 5:00 a boiling pot of Minestrone soup will be wheeled in and you're going in it.

An angel ushers the Jewish man into a room filled with every type of Jewish delicacy imaginable and instructs him - you can eat whatever you want, but if you eat anything from this table, at 5:00 a boiling pot of chicken soup will be wheeled in and you're going in it. 

The Jewish guy thinks for a moment and begins stuffing his face with food. 

The puzzled angel has never seen this before. No one ever dared to eat the food in fear of being thrown into the boiling soup. He asked the Jewish fellow - I don't understand, the Frenchman and Italian were too scared to eat, are you not afraid?

The Jewish guy answered - nah, I know how these Jewish events work, 5:00 is never 5:00 and the soup is never that hot.

An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman are driving through a desert. An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman are driving through a desert when their car breaks down. They decide they must walk across the desert. The Englishman takes an umbrella out of the boot and begins walking. The Irishman takes out his flask, fills it with whisky and follows the Englishman. The scot rips the door off the car and runs to catch up with the others. 

Sometime later they come across an Arab caravan. A man walks up to them and says to the Englishman ‘Sahib, you know that it does not rain around these parts?’ The Englishman replies ‘Ah but you see it is not for the rain, it is for the sun.’ And so the Arab knew the Englishman was truly wise. He turns to the Irishman and says ‘You have a flask but it is not filled with water?’ ‘Well you see’ says the Irishman ‘water can be trouble around here so I filled it with something more precious instead.’ And so the Arab knew the Irishman was truly wise. ‘And you sir, for what reason do you carry the door?’ so the Scotsman says ‘Well I figure, if I get too hot I can just wind down the window.’

A farmer was letting his 26 cows graze on a field near his farm with his dog when suddenly he sees a rain cloud approach. He doesn't want his animals getting soaked or they might end up cold. 

He quickly scavenges for a bunch of branches and combines it with a tarp that he brought just for this occasion to build a make shift shelter. He whistles for his dog to herd them under the haphazard roof. He does a quick count and is shocked to find he suddenly has 30 cows. 

The next day he brings his wife along with his cows. Without even waiting for rain he builds a canvas roof and herds all his cows inside and again his 26 cows turn into 30. But his wife is less than impressed. 

"Don't you think that's amazing?!" he asks her.

The Wife replies, "It's just as expected, you rounded them up to the nearest tent."

So I was jogging around the track at the gym and this really hot Latina chick passed me. I gave her a friendly wave and said "hola." However, she kept running and didn't say anything to me. I shrugged and kept going, thinking that maybe she didn't hear me. About 10 minutes later, she caught up to me again, and I once more waved and said "hola." Still, she kept her eyes straight ahead as she passed me and didn't respond. At this point, I was a little offended and felt determined to at least get a response of some kind from her.  

Finally, about 10 minutes later she caught up to me again, and as she passed I said "hola" somewhat louder than before. She finally slowed down and turned back to me and said "A few times I've been around this track, so it's not just gonna happen like that, 'cause I ain't no hola back girl!"

A Man Escapes From Prison A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years. He breaks into a house to look for money and guns and finds a young couple in bed. 

He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:

"Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you."

To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!"

The alien vessel landed quietly on St Peter's square in Rome... A hatch opened and two little grey men with dazzling smiles appeared. They were promptly granted an audience with the Pope.

After a brief discussion about the weather, the Pope said, "I know this question may sound odd to you, but I was wondering if you and your kind knew about Jesus Christ?"

"Jesus Christ?!" exclaimed the slightly taller of two aliens. "Of course we do! He visits our planet every two years or so. Awesome fellow!"

A hush descended on the audience chamber, and everyone watched the Pope, whose face had turned a rather odd purple.

"Every two years?" he shouted. "We're still waiting for his second coming!"

"Maybe he didn't like your chocolate?" suggested the alien.

"Chocolate?" replied the Pope. "What in heaven's name does chocolate have to do with it?"

"Well," said the alien. "When he came to our planet, we gave him chocolate. Why, what did you do?"

A sex addict decided to repent and volunteer in the local church... The first day, the priest was teaching him the new job. A girl walked into the church and confessed that she commited adultery once. The priest said: "You need to donate one dollar to the church so God may forgive you". So she did that and left. Then came another woman and confessed commiting adultery twice, so the priest told her she needs to donate two dollars to the church. Then the priest said:"You got the hang of it, I'm going to the bathroom and you need to do the same thing until I come back, and remember, never take more money than you should". When the priest came back he found the new guy fucking a woman on the altar, he got mad and started yelling: "Are you out of your mind! What are you doing?!" The sex addict replied: "Calm down man, this one said she commited adultery eight times and she donated a 10 dollar bill and I didn't have any change to give back to her so I had to fuck her twice".

The french note A guy was going on a vacation to France. He was aware of that most french people don't speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. "Hi, I came for the french lesson today" our guy said. "Oh, I'm sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week." "So there is no one that know any french here?" "No I'm sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don't know what to say, and it should work out fine" "Uhm ok. What does it say?" "I'm sorry, I don't know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone." Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn't have time to order a new lesson anyway.

The day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. "Well that's weird. Maybe the note isn't ment for cab drivers" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he'd give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren't happy about it. 
"That's it. I've had enough of this, tomorrow I'm going back home!" our guy thought, and so he did.

Luckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said.

Three legged chicken..... It was Spring Break and several friends arranged to spend the week in a cabin in a remote, forested region about 3 hours from school.   

There was nothing noteworthy about the first two hours, but it was as if we’d entered a strange new world once we’d left the interstate highways to proceed on farm roads with odd names and/or numbers.
No other cars.   These paved roads appeared well-worn, but it was unfamiliar!  There were barbed wire fences on both sides of this two lane road and random horses and cows.    

Then, suddenly, there was a blur that burst past the side of our car.

What was that?!  We both uttered these words, simultaneously.    We decided to find out.   

I was driving 60mph, so I sped up to 70mph.   I was gaining on the blur, but it was clear I needed to go faster if I had any hope to identify this freakishly speedy blur.

I accelerated to 80mph but it seemed to be moving much faster.   Just as I exceeded 90mph I realized I’d never match it’s speed.  But suddenly the blur made a right turn onto an humble dirt road.  

I screeched to a halt.  My buddy said, ‘you gotta turn around and try to see what that thing was!!’  I was curious, as well, so that’s precisely what I did.

I cautiously proceeded down this dirt road and it was less than 1/2mile when we noticed a broken down wooden shack of a home.   On the porch were three folks in rocking chairs.  I parked my car and stepped out, politely announcing my name and asking if these folks had seen this blur that had us so perplexed!

“Oh, yeah”, responded the old lady.   “That was one of our three legged chickens.”

My buddy reacted, “three legged chickens?”

She continued, “well, me, Paw and Jr. all LOVE chicken legs.  It was Jr’s idea.   He said we needed to raise three legged chickens!  And that’s what we did!  That blur---you seen one of em!’  

Jr’s beeming  pride was obvious as he smiled a smile so incredible it exposed his dozen remaining teeth!!  The American Dental Association would have been bewildered, speechless!

“Sounds like a great idea!”, I said.  I continued, “So…..how do they taste?”

Jr’s smile evaporated as Maw responded, “don’t know.   Can’t catch ‘em.”

A woman is at home when she hears someone...... A woman is at home when she hears someone knocking at her door.
She goes to the door opens it and sees a man standing there.
He asks the lady, "Do you have a Vagina?"
She slams the door in disgust.
The next morning she hears a knock at the door, its the same man and he asks the same question to the woman, "Do you have a Vagina?"
She slams the door again.
Later that night when her husband gets home she tell him what has happened for the last two days.
The husband tells his wife in a loving and concerned voice, "Honey, I am taking an off tomorrow so as to be home, just incase this guy shows up again."
The next morning they hear a knock at the door and both ran for the door. 
The husband whisperes to the wife, "Honey, im going to hide behind the door and listen and if it is the same guy I want you to answer yes to the
question because I want to a see where he's going with this."
She nods yes to her husband and opens the door.
Sure enough the same fellow is standing there, he asks, "Do you have a Vagina?"
"Yes I do." says the lady.
The man replies, "Good, would you mind telling your husband to leave my wife's alone and start using yours!"
A British guy, a Frenchman and a Russian were in a bar debating whether Adam and Eve were British, French, or Russian. 

The British guy says, " Obviously they were both British, observe how Adam offered Eve some of his apple after he received it from her, true British manners".

French guy says: "Non, non, monsieur they were both French. First of all they were both NAKED, and Eve was so feminine and seductive and drove Adam nuts".

Russian guy says: "Both of you are wrong. I can prove conclusively that Adam and Eve were nothing but Russian. They had no clothes. They had no heat.  All that was left to eat was one lousy apple and they called it paradise!"

So the American jumps from the top floor and sure enough; just as he goes past the 7th floor, he slows down and lands on the 4th. 

"Fucking fun!" says the Irish guy as he jumps. And falls to his death.

A girl with no arms and legs goes to the beach A girl with no arms and no legs goes to the beach with her mother. While they are sitting on the beach, she starts crying and tells her mother that she's never gotten a hug before and  she thinks the lifeguard is really cute and has her mother ask him if she can get a hug from him.

Mom goes up to the lifeguard and tells him her daughter wants a hug. So he comes over while she is still crying and gives her a hug. As he's walking away, she starts crying more and the lifeguard asks what is wrong. She says she's never had a kiss before and asks if he could give her a kiss. The lifeguard is a little reluctant but gives her a kiss. As he is walking away the girl starts crying hysterically, and now the lifeguard is thinking, what the hell is wrong with her. He says to her "what's wrong" and she says back, "I've never had sex before, I've never been fucked"... the lifeguard then picks her up, walks over to the ocean and throws her in and shouts "THERE! NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!"
Man travels to Spain A man travels to Spain and decides to watch one of the bullfighting matches for which Spain is well known. 

The match was intense & thrilling. Unlike anything which can be found anywhere else in the world. Afterwards there was a celebration for the Torero (Bullfighter) and the crowd slowly dispersed, with the man leaving among the last of them so that he could savor the experience. 

Once he'd exited the arena, he noticed large groups from the group gathering at a restaurant across the street. Hungry, the man followed as well and decided to experience the native cuisine. 

As the night progressed, he had joined a few others at a table and began chatting with them joyously about the match. Until he noticed that at one table a very wealthy looking man had been made the center of attention by the restaurants staff as the chef personally brought out a special silver plate with strange meat on them.

Curious, the man asked his new friends what was so special about that man. One of the men at his table explained that the man was a foreigner, much like him, who has payed handsomely for the privilege of eating the spirit of the bull which died in the arena. Which according to them was symbolically located in the testicles of the powerful animal. 

Obviously amazed by the ritual, he noticed how excited & happy the man was. Being quite wealthy himself, he asked if there was any way for him to pay for the same honor. After a short talk with the restaurants owner, he came to an agreement and reserved a plate for tomorrow.

Though he didn't get a chance to watch the bullfights that day, he had anxiously been waiting since the previous night for this moment. And now that he was at the restaurant he couldn't help but rush to his table and wait for his meal.

After a few moments, the staff gathered and the chef brought out the same plate as the previous night, except that there was noticeably less meat on it this time.

Confused, the man asked the chef if the bull had been smaller than the one from yesterday.

The chef merely replied that the bull is quite large, alive, and in good health, it was the Torero who lost today.

A Hispanic carpenter is feeling depressed After living a life of always reading other people's directions and instructions to do his job, he decides he wants to to make his *own* decision for once: Committing suicide. 

So he scribbles down some words on a piece of paper and reviews what he wrote, nodding in approval. He hops into his car in his garage and tapes a garden hose to the exhaust pipe. He starts his car and puts the hose in his mouth, inhaling deeply, anticipating the sweet release of death. Soon after, he succumbs to his poison of choice and falls down, dying slowly as if he was simply falling asleep.

His wife comes home and discovers him. Horrified, she sees a piece of paper next to him and picks it up, thinking it will be a suicide note to give her some clarity on what made him choose this terrible act. In familiar handwriting, she sees scribbled on the page:

A Genius, an Old Farmer, and a Boy Scout are on a plane... ...The pilot enters the cabin and says, "I'm terribly sorry. I've done everything I can, but the plane is falling and going to crash. Now, there are only 3 parachutes on this plane. I've got a wife at home with 2 young kids and another on the way, so I'm going to use one of them." He then picks up a parachute, puts it on, and jumps out of the plane.

The Genius says, "I am the smartest person in the world. My death would be a huge loss because of my immense knowledge. I simply must survive this crash." He follows after the pilot.

The Old Farmer looks at the Boy Scout and says, "Well, son, I've lived a long, fulfilling life. You have your whole future ahead of you. You take the last parachute." The Boy Scout replies, "Don't worry sir, we'll both survive. The Genius took my backpack."

A lovely woman is first in line at a bus stop. The bus opens its doors to let her on. She lifts her leg for the step and funds she cannot reach it. She realizes it must be her tight dress and reaches back and unzips it a little bit. 

Again, she brings her leg up and still cannot reach the first step of the bus. A little more embarrassed, she reaches back again and unzips her dress a good deal more. 

But again, her foot falls just short of the step. Finally she reaches back and unzips the dress almost all the way. At this point the young man behind her reaches forward, grabs her by the hips and lifts her to the step. 

Infuriated, she turns and nearly screams, "And what made you think you had permission to touch me like that!?" 

The man calmly replies, "Well, after you reaches back and unzipped my fly three times I kinda figured we were friends."

What type of soup would you like? Work was pretty slow tonight, which was odd considering we were trying out two new soups, Spicy Ham or Mutton, normally stuff like this brings people in. But on the flip side I got to talk to some of the regulars. One of them was this women who's parents apparently snuck out of Africa during a violent revolt. After getting to America they settled down and tried to start a family. Unfortunately after after 3 years of trying nothing had happened, so they were about to give up. 
    As a final attempt they went on vacation to Miami to "get the spark back" and while there they met Betty White, who turns out is super sweet and friendly. She encouraged them to keep trying trying since they love each other, it will work out, which two weeks later it did. Out of gratitude they named Fleur daughter Betty.
  By this point in her story my manager told me to take her order, no one had showed up, but I was being unprofessional. So she orders asking if we have any clam chowder, we didn't so I told her, No Black Betty Ham or Lamb.

The Ant and the Grasshopper 
CLASSIC VERSION: 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. 

MODERN VERSION: 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. 

CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? 

Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with "green bias," and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. 

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings "It's Not Easy Being Green." Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the "Temperatures of the 80's."

Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share." Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act" retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. 

Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. 

The ant loses the case. 

The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. 

The ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of "fairness" has dawned in America. 
A failed tv presenter, a disgraced newspaper editor and a phone hacker walk into a bar.... ..and the barman says "What'll it be, Piers?"

Are my testicles black? "NSFW" ARE MY TESTICLES BLACK? 

A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth. 

A young student nurse appears and gives him a partial sponge bath. 

"Nurse," he mumbles from behind the mask, "Are my testicles black?" 

Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet." 

He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?" 

Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other. She looks very closely and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look magnificent." 

The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, "Thank you very much. That was wonderful. Now listen very, very closely: "Are- My - Test - Results - Back?"

She didn't realize tapping him on the shoulder would make him do this. A lady in a taxi leaned forward to ask the driver a question. She gently tapped his shoulder to get his attention.

The driver screamed, lost control of the cab and nearly hit a bus. He drove over the curb, almost going through a shop window.

For a few moments the inside of the cab was silent. The shaken driver turned and said, "Are you ok? I'm very sorry, but you scared the piss out of me!" 

The passenger, very startled at this point, apologizes to the driver and says "I didn't realize a mere tap on the shoulder could scare some one so bad" 

The driver replied "no, no, I'm the one who is sorry, today is my first day driving a cab. I've been driving a hearse for over 20 years!"
Grasshopper Every day, Jim gets two six packs on the way home from work. When he gets home, he sits in his living room until they're gone. One day, just as he's getting to the end of the last beer, he hears a knock at the door. He goes to answer it, and sees a six foot tall grasshopper. Before he can say a word, the grasshopper punches him in the face as hard as he's ever been hit! Floored, he can't respond before the grasshopper leaves.
He decides he'd better be in better shape, so the next day he only gets one six pack. Just as he's finishing the last beer, he hears another knock at the door. He gets up to answer it, a bit more wary this time. Not that it does him any good. The six foot tall grasshopper is there again, and this time hits him twice, each one as hard as he's ever been hit! Again, the grasshopper leaves before he can do anything.
On the third day, he decides he'd better just skip his beer. He's sitting in his living room, stone cold sober, when he hears a knock at the door. He checks his peephole. It's the grasshopper. But he figures this time he hasn't been drinking and he can take him, so he opens the door. Before he can do anything, the grasshopper knocks him down and kicks him until he can't move. Again, the grasshopper leaves when it's done.
Obviously he's in bad shape after that, so he goes in to see his doctor. He describes what's been going on. The doctor nods knowingly, "Yeah, there's been a pretty nasty bug going around."

A young liberal arts student walks into a bar... A young liberal arts student walks into a bar. He sat down and ordered 2 beers. 

An Asian guy sitting on his right hand side stared at him and went: so, how does it feel to be in the mid 20s but still live with your parents? 

The young liberal arts student was instantly surprised. "Yes! I lives with my parents!" he thought to himself:"but how did this guy know? Do I know this guy?" He then did a quick brain search, but couldn't think of a single Asian guy he knew. So he maintained his composure, and replied calmly: "Sir, I'm sure you mistook me for someone else. I moved out the day I enrolled in college."

5 minutes later, the Asian guy tried again to start a conversation by saying:"So, did your dad get the tenure? Or still an assistant prof?"

The young liberal arts student got flabbergasted! His father actually teach in the same college he attends! What's going on? Is this Asian guy a family friend? He searched through his mind once more. Nope, couldn't think of any Asian guy he had ever made acquaintance under any circumstance. Probably just some random drunk. So he replied: "Look, I don't know who you are but you better leave me alone. My father is a lawyer, not a teacher."

Soon an African guy walked in and sat on his left. The African guy took a glance at him and went:"Hey there young fellow, how's your culture study thesis going?"

The young liberal arts student was completely baffled. "Oh my god." He thought."I am working on a culture study thesis! How the hell did he know! I'm positive I don't know this guy!"

"OK!" the young liberal arts student finally snapped:"OK I lied. I live with my parents. I have a father that is teaching at the same college I go to. And I'm a culture studies major. OK, you got me, you happy? But how the fuck did you know? I don't fucking know you! I don't fucking know any of you! Just wtf is going on???"

How do you know? An air traffic control tower suddenly lost communication with a small twin engine aircraft. A moment later the tower landline rang and was answered by one of the employees. The passenger riding with the pilot who lost communications was on a cellular phone.

“Mayday, mayday! The pilot had an instant and fatal heart attack. I grabbed his cell phone out of his pocket and he had told me before we took off he had the tower on his speed dial memory. I am flying upside down at 18,000 feet and traveling at 180 mph. Mayday, mayday!”

The employee in the tower immediately put him on speaker phone. “Calm down, we acknowledge you and we’ll guide you down after a few questions. The first thing is not to panic. Remain calm!”

He began his series of questions:

Tower: “How do you know you are traveling at 18,000 feet??”

Aircraft: “I can see that it reads 18,000 feet on the altimeter dial in front of me.”

Tower: “Okay, that’s good, remain calm. How do you know you’re traveling at 180 mph?”

Aircraft: “I can see that it reads 180 mph on the airspeed dial in front of me.”

Tower: "Okay, this is great so far, but it’s heavily overcast. So how do you know you’re flying upside down?"

Aircraft: “The shit in my pants is running out of my shirt collar.”

Indian Jews! Two Jewish men, Sid and Al, were sitting in a Indian restaurant in New York
.. Sid asked Al, 'Are there any Jewish people of our faith born and raised in India ?'

Al replied, 'I don't know, let's just ask our waiter.'

When the waiter came by, Al asked him, 'Are there any Indian Jews?'

The waiter said, 'I doont be knowing, I ask cooksaheb..' He returned from the kitchen in a few minutes and said, 'No sir, no Indian Jews.'

Al wasn't really satisfied with that and asked, 'Are you absolutely sure?'

The waiter, realizing he was dealing with 'foreigners' gave the expected answer, 'I check again,' and went back into the kitchen.

While the waiter was away in the kitchen, Sid said, 'I find it hard to believe that there are no Jews in India   . Our people are scattered everywhere.'

The waiter returned and said, 'Cooksaheb say there is no Indian Jews.'

'Are you certain?' Al asked once again, 'I just can't believe there are no Indian Jews!'

! Listen, I asked EVERYONE,' replied the frustrated waiter.
'All we have is Mango Jews, Pineapple Jews, Orange Jews, Coconut Jews &
Tomato Jews!   - No Indian Jews !!!'
A group of bureaucrats from the EU are out on a chartered luxury liner through the Pacific. A storm blows up, the cruiser starts to sink, and everyone abandons ship. By a quirk of fate, the only survivors are two men and one woman from each of the EU countries. They stagger onto the shore of a beautiful desert island. After three months, things have changed.

One Italian man has killed the other Italian man in a fight over the Italian woman.

The two Frenchmen and the French woman are enjoying a threesome, but complain bitterly about the multitude of foreigners on their island.

The two Englishmen are waiting patiently for someone to introduce them to the English woman.

The German men have a strict, weekly alternating sex schedule; the woman gets weekends off.

The Dutch men are fully prepared, in general, to share the woman. However, they are still debating how to ensure that both will have an exactly equal share, how to reduce supervision cost, and how to guarantee the woman equal rights. They are writing to the Hague.

The Luxemburg men are still recovering from the shock of seeing half the population of Luxembourg stranded on the island. But they will soon start collecting seashells on the beach.

The Finnish men took one look at the endless ocean, one look at the Finnish woman, and started swimming.

They were soon overtaken by the Portuguese men.

The Danish trio embarked on a search for people to join them in an orgy. They gladly accepted the participation of the Finnish woman, and are still vainly trying to persuade the Portuguese woman.

The Spanish men are protecting the virginity of the Spanish woman and are constantly suspiciously spying on one another. Meanwhile, she dances flamenco.

The Austrian men initiated a yodelling contest for the woman. The loser immediately started learning flamenco, as well as Portuguese, Finnish and Danish.

The Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.

The Swedish woman keeps on bitching about female exploitation while the men are sunbathing and waiting for her to tell them what to do.

The Irish began by setting up a distillery for which they expect to receive a substantial EU subsidy. They don't recall if sex is in the picture, because it gets sort of foggy after the first few rounds of coconut whisky. But they're happy that, at least, the English aren't getting any.

He sees three lone sacks and proceeds to kick them one by one. When he kicks the first one, Tom barks softly "bow wow". The officer thinks it must be a puppy, and proceeds to the next one. This time Harry growls like a cat "grrrr"."Must be a
kitten", he thinks and goes to the next sack. By this time Dick had everything figured out, so when the officer kicks him, he shouts "potato".

Rabbi and the bicycle A visibly upset man goes to see his rabbi one day and says: 
"Rabbi, you won't believe what happened to me! Last week, someone stole my bicycle from the synagogue!"
The rabbi is deeply upset by this, but after thinking for a moment, he offers a solution: "Next week come to services, sit in the front row, and when we recite the Ten Commandments, turn around and look at the people behing you. And when we got to 'Thou shalt not steal,' see who can't look you in the eyes and that's your guy."
The rabbi is very pleased with his suggestion, and so is the man. 
And next service, the rabbi is very curious to learn whether his advice  worked. He waits for the man by the doors of the synagogue, and asks him "So dit it work? "

"Like a charm," the man answers. "The moment we got to 'Thou shalt not commit adultery,' I remembered where I left my bicycle."

So Satan asks God to let him back into Heaven... God says "Satan, you've betrayed me before, but I am a just and forgiving god. You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest."

Satan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. 

Easter Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. 

One hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it's a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. 

By 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. 

By noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. 

At 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. 

By 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can't be perfectly formatted. 

2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces "JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!" 

Satan is furious. "How can this be?" He asks. "I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!"

Jesus taunts Satan. "Well I don't see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off."

"Your computer was shut off, too!" Satan retorts. "I guess neither of us win!" 

God, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan's coding cannot be found, but when Jesus's computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. 

"How can this be?" Satan snarls. "I finished more coding! It should be there! I should've won this!" 

"Satan, my friend," God says, "You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... 

Jesus saves."

A young American man moves to the Shetland Isles Unbeknownst to him, the Shetland peoples are quite reserved, and no-one visits him for three months.

One stormy night, there's a loud knock at the door. He opens the door to the sight of a huge, fiery-haired man with a thick beard. With an accent equally as thick, the visitor says, "I've come to invite ye to a party."

"Wonderful," says the American, "I'd love to go!"

"I must warn ye, lad. The drinks will be flowin' aplenty."

"That's no problem, I've been known to enjoy a strong scotch now and again," replies the American.

"They'll likely be a fight too," says the bearded man. "Where there's drinkin' and dancin' there's always a fight."

"I'm not worried, I was middleweight champion in boxing back in the navy. I'm sure I can hold my own."

"Alright, lad. But one last thing. There's likely to be sex involved too. Hairy-arsed, drunken sex."

The American smirks. "Well, after being alone for so many months, that's not out of the question either. One question though: what should I wear?"

The big man chuckles and replies, "Ah, come as you are, it's just gonna be you and me."

The Fireman A man worked at the Fire Dept. and came home one night suggesting to his wife that they could sort of do the same thing as he did when he went to fight fires.  He said, "I could come home and say Bell 1 and we could run to the bedroom; Bell 2 and we could take our clothes off; and Bell 3, we could start messing around."  So the wife agreed.  The next night the man came home and said "Bell 1" and they ran to the bedroom; "Bell 2" and they took off their clothes; "Bell 3" and they began to mess around.  Then the wife said "Bell 4."  "What does that mean?" he said to which she replied: "More hose, you're nowhere near the fire."

The Historians Mural A historian bought a house and being the civil war era buff that he was, he wanted a mural of Custers Last Stand to be painted in his new home.

The historian called in a reputable artist to have him paint the mural for him. He said to the artist

"I want a mural to be painted of general custers last stand, i want it to capture the moment general custer realized his defeat. I would like it done before i return from vacation next month"

The artist obliged and said he had something perfect in mind.

A month passed and the historian returned from vacation. The artist, waiting beside the covered mural, ready to present it to the historian pulled the cover away.

What the historian saw was an intricately detailed painting of a large cow in the center, praying, with a halo above its head, surrounded by hundreds of native americans in erotic positions fornicating with one another

Outraged, the historian looked at the artist and yelled

"What the hell is this?! I asked for custers last stand and you painted pornography on my wall!!"

The artist simply replied

"Well yes sir, thats what ive given you. I call it, holy cow, look at all those fucking indians!"

A nun decides to go golfing and invites a priest to be her caddy. On the first hole, the nun hits an excellent shot, landing the ball right on the green. A short golf cart ride later, she putts and the ball rolls right toward the hole but veers left at the second. "God, I missed!" yells the nun. "Now, now, sister," the priest remarks, "don't use the Lord's name in vain, or he will strike you down." The nun shrugs him off and prepares to putt again.
 
On the tenth hole, the nun again hits a wonderful shot, landing the ball once again on the green. The pair drives over to the green. The nun putts the ball and but it skips over the hole. "God, I missed!" the nun exclaims again. "Be careful, sister l, one must never use the Lord's name in vain, for he will surely strike you down!" the priest warns. "Yeah, I heard you the first time," says the nun dismissively.
 
On the eighteenth hole, after a spectacular shot landing the ball mere metres from the hole, the nun gently taps the ball toward the hole. It rolls gracefully toward its target, spins around the inside of the hole and hops back out, resting firmly right on the edge. Infuriated, the nun shouts, "God, I missed!" Suddenly, the sky darkens and the smell of sulphur thickens the air. A massive and terrifying bolt of white lighting streaks down from the sky: a tendril of pure, divine, death-seeking light energy. With an eardrum-shattering crack and a blinding flash, it strikes the priest dead.

I made an accidental pun today... I guess it was kinda "PUNintentional"
We had our first child and he's beautiful, but he had a rare birth defect. He was born without eyelids. We had to keep his eyes irrigated and shielded from light while they searched for a pediatric plastic surgeon who could correct it.

Fortunately one of the top surgeons in our region was available. When our attending physician explained the situation to him, he asked, "Has the patient been circumcised yet?" Our doc replied that he hadn't, and the surgeon explained his plan.

The NICU cut a short length of 5mm silicone tubing and placed it over the tip of our newborn's penis, then carefully stretched his little foreskin over the end of the tubing and taped it in place. After 12 hours they replaced it with 7.5mm tubing, then after 24 hours they replaced that with 10mm tubing.

The next day the surgeon arrived. They wheeled our baby into surgery where he performed the circumcision and then immediately used the recovered, stretched tissue to replace the missing eyelids.

Afterward, the surgeon explained to us that he's done this surgery only three times before but it was always successful, and since it used the baby's own tissue there was virtually no chance of rejection.

We thanked the surgeon and asked if there were any side effects we should look out for.

"Well," he said thoughtfully, "he'll probably be a little cockeyed."

Slower, and this time with sign language, the man who needs condoms mouths again that he needs condoms. Still confused, the pharmacist shakes his head and explains he doesn't understand. The deaf/mute man starts mouthing the word "sex" over and again, pointing at his crotch, and again, slowly mouths the word "CON-DOM". Still, the pharmacist looks at him perplexed. 

Exasperated, the deaf/mute man finally unzips his pants, pulls a $10 bill out of his pocket, and simultaneously puts the money and his penis on the table. He points to the money, points to his penis, points at the pharmacist, and points at a shelf behind the pharmacist where condoms are on display. The pharmacist unzips his pants, puts his own penis on the table, and picks up the ten dollars.

The deaf/mute man begins throwing a fit. The pharmacist calmly looks at him and says "Well, if you're afraid to lose, don't play the game".

Science professor It is the new school year, and the science class sits down. The professor walks in with a dead body on a stretcher. The whole class screams and cringes at the sight of the body.

The professor says, "Calm down class. Now, in this class you will be doing many things that may provoke feelings of disgust, but you must do them in the name of science. To help you overcome your fear, I brought in this doner body." The professor then puts his finger into the body's anus, and then puts the finger into his mouth. "Now, I want all of you to do what I did, put your finger in the anus of the body, then put your finger in your mouth. I will give you a zero if you do not do this."

The students, not wanting to get a zero, one by one, put their fingers in the corpse, then in their mouths.

Still frowning I ran to the kitchen, picked up our fridge and threw it out the bedroom window smashing my wifes lover like a melon. Apparently this was more than my heart could take and I died from a heart attack"

Gabriel: "Sure is a good death story, you may enter"

Luckily my downstair neighbor had an open window and by quick reacting I grabbed the ledge by the tip of my fingers. But would you believe it, some douchebag fuck start hammering my fingers until I let go and fall down 4 stories.

Some friends and I were going to a Halloween party... My friends Warren, Nicholas, and I were going to a Halloween party. We needed to pick out costumes. Being an avid cosplayer, Nicholas, who we called Nick, was going as the iron giants. I'm more inclined to go with a simple costume, as I have in the past. I went as a roll of toilet paper. Warren, who we called War because it sounds better than 'Ren,' could not for the life of him choose what to wear.

So we went to the costume store and looked at every single outfit we could. He decided to pick out a ninja turtle outfit. Well, our friend Catherine, who we called Kate, was there and she was also going to be a ninja turtle. She became a bit upset at the thought of wearing the same thing as War. 

"Look," Kate told Nick, " I know that if it were you that picked out the same costume as me, you'd change it. Same to you," she told me. "You guys are reasonable like that. But War. War never changes."

One day, she told her problem to a brunette she worked with at a salon. The brunette told her, "There is a possibility to make the car easier to sell, but it's not legal." "That doesn't matter," replied the blonde, "If I only can sell the car. "Okay," said the brunette. "Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop. Tell him I sent you and he will turn the counter in your car back to 50,000 miles. Then it should not be a problem to sell your car anymore." The following weekend, the blonde made the trip to the mechanic. About one month after that, the brunette asked the blonde, "Did you sell your car?" "No," replied the blonde, "why should I? It only has 60,000 miles on it."

Finally, angry and frustrated, he gives up and pays the blonde $500 The blonde put the $500 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insists, “What is the answer to your question?” Without saying a word, the blonde hands him $5.

A heart of gold. A local charity had never received a donation from the town’s banker, so the director made a phone call. “Our records show you make $500,000 a year, yet you haven’t given a penny to charity,” the director began. “Wouldn’t you like to help the community?”

The banker replied, “Did your research show that my mother is ill, with extremely expensive medical bills?”

“Um, no,” mumbled the director.

“Or that my brother is unemployed? Or that my sister’s husband left, leaving her broke with four kids?”

“I … I … I had no idea.”

“So,” said the banker, “if I don’t give them any money, why would I give any to you?”

Have you heard the one about the Australian Aboriginal, the copper and the mud crab? There's an aboriginal man who's been hunting for crabs in the mangroves and he hadn't been having much luck. All of a sudden he spots the biggest juiciest mud crab he's ever laid his eyes on. He throws it in his bucket with a bit of water then throws the bucket In the trunk of his car to go home and cook up his grub! oh boy he was licking his lips thinking of that crab with a bit of melted butter and lemon.

He's driving. he hears a siren and sees the lights of a police officer insisting he pull over. 

"Here we bloody go" he's thinking. 

So the copper raps on his window and says "excuse me sir, are you aware of your car dripping water from the boot?". 

"ahhh naaa mate... not sure what you're talking about officer".

"Sir, please open the trunk".

"yeh no worries".

And so this aboriginal man opens the trunk and the officer gasps when he sees the size of the mudcrab.

"Sir are you aware it's illegal to be fishing for mud crab at this time of the year?" says the constable. 

The aboriginal fella looked genuinely confused. 

"naaaa brother you got it all wrong. this is my pet crab, Larry. Owned him for years. I was just taking him for a splash down at the mangrove". 

"yeah bullshit mate! you must think I'm an idiot"

"come back to the mangrove. it's not far away and I will prove to you this is my pet" says the aboriginal while stifling a smile.

The officer entertains the idea because what harm can it do. they both make their way a short distance to the mangrove edge. the man pulls his pet from the bucket and lowers the crab back into the murky water where it slowly scurried away and disappeared into the mud. And so the aboriginal man slowly stands while dusting off his hands and turns to the officer who's patiently waiting. the officer asks..

"well mate you said the mud crab would come back to you when you called his name???"

The aboriginal man looks the officer in the eyes and with only the slightest twitch in his upper lip says..













"WHAT MUD CRAB!!!"

"Father, are you alright? What happened?" inquired the priest.

Joseph looked up, tears streaming down his cheek, and said "They said Celebrate...CELEBRATE!"

Turns out there are TWO Loch Ness Monsters. One of them is quite mean, but the other actually gives away his forestry tools. A little weird, sure, but it's always nice to see some random axe of Kind Ness.
Indian business Joseph Mandelbaum and Benjamin Rosenblatt,  partners in the garment industry, are having their worst season ever. Ten thousand Madras sports coats are hanging on the rack unsold, and bankruptcy is imminent.

Out of the blue, in walks a buyer from Australia looking for Madras sports jackets.

"Would you guys have any for sale?" asks the Australian, "I have been looking for them
everywhere."

After a brief pause to catch his breath, Joseph admits that there might be a few left. Soon a deal is concluded for ten thousand jackets, to be shipped to Australia at a handsome profit.

"There is one thing;" says the buyer, "for this large order I need to get confirmation from my home office. There should be no problem, so unless I send you a cable by the end of the week, the deal is on."

The week creeps by, with the partners anxiously waiting to see if the Australian will change his mind.
At ten minutes to five on Friday, Benjamin is closing up the shop when there is a knock at the door and a voice shouts, "Telegram!"

The partners freeze. Trembling, Joseph grabs the cable and opens it. Suddenly his face lights up.

I lost my watch at a party once... An hour later I saw some guy stepping on it while he was sexually harassing some woman at that party. Infuriated, I immediately went over, punched him and broke his nose. No one does that to a woman, not on my watch.

A young boy, about eight years old, was at the corner grocery picking out a large size box of laundry detergent... The grocer walked over and trying to be friendly, asked the boy if he had a lot of laundry to do.

"Nope, no laundry," the boy said, "I'm going to wash my dog."

"But, you shouldn't use this to wash your dog. It's very powerful and if you wash your dog in this, he'll get sick. In fact, it might even kill him."

But, the boy was not to be stopped and carried the detergent to the counter and paid for it, even as the grocer still tried to talk him out of washing his dog.

About a week later, the boy was back in the store to buy some candy. 

The grocer asked the boy how his dog was doing.

"Oh, he died." the boy said.

The grocer, trying not to be an "I-told-you-so" said he was sorry the dog died, but added, "I tried to tell you not to use that detergent on your dog."

"Well, the boy replied, "I don't think it was the detergent that killed him."

"Oh? What was it then?"

"I think it was the spin cycle."

An old geezer, who had been a retired..... An old geezer, who had been a retired farmer for a long time became very bored and decided to open a medical clinic. 
He put a sign up outside that said: "Get your treatment for $500 - if not cured get back $1,000."
Doctor "Young," who was positive that this old geezer didn't know beans about medicine, thought this would be a great opportunity to get $1,000. 
He went to Dr. Geezer's clinic and this is what happened.
Dr. Young: "Dr. Geezer, I have lost all taste in my mouth. Can you please help me? 
Dr. Geezer: "Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in Dr. Young's mouth." 
Dr. Young: "Aaagh! This is Gasoline!" 
Dr. Geezer: "Congratulations! You've got your taste back. That will be $500."
Dr. Young gets annoyed and goes back after a couple of days figuring to recover his money. 
Dr Young: "I have lost my memory, I cannot remember anything." 
Dr. Geezer: "Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in the patient's mouth." 
Doctor Young: "Oh no you don't, that's Gasoline!" 
Dr. Geezer: "Congratulations! You've got your memory back. That will be $500."
Dr. Young (after having lost $1000) leaves angrily and comes back after several more days. 
Dr. Young: "My eyesight has become weak I can hardly see!" 
Dr. Geezer: "Well, I don't have any medicine for that so. Here's your $1000 back." 
Dr. Young: "But this is only $500..." 
Dr. Geezer: "Congratulations! You got your vision back! That will be $500."

Moral of story: Just because you're "Young" doesn't mean that you can outsmart an old "Geezer "

"Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move," answered the child innocently. "You did WHAT?!?!?!" the teacher yelled in shock. "You know," explained the boy, "I leaned over and went 'Pssst!' and it didn't move."
