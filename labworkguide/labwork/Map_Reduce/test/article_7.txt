Nihilist Horse Walks in to a Bar A Horse walks into a bar.
The Bartender sees such a vivid depth
of despair and dissatisfaction in the Horse's eyes,
like the Horse has stared into the abyss
and found the infinite void of nothingness so deep
that the Horse could no longer believe
that he himself nor anyone nor anything else existed.
To say something exists requires knowledge of self,
which requires knowledge of existence of the self, 
an obviously impossible leap of logic,
absurd to even attempt to conceive or contemplate.
The Bartender,
in that single instant within the Horse's mind,
became the nothingness the Horse perceived, 
and thus was rendered speechless.
If neither the Horse,
nor the Bartender,
nor the bar itself can be said to exist,
then why should he ask,
how could he ask,
"why the long face?"
The question can have no meaning,
and that which has no meaning cannot be stated.
The Bartender, dumbstruck, not by realization of mortality
but by fundamental doubt that he was ever alive,
gazes into the endless depth of the Horse's eyes,
and asks him, "Sir, I beg you say, do I exist?"
The Horse replies,
"Neighhhh..."

Attention! My cousin has 2 tickets for the 2017 SUPER BOWL, both box seats. He paid $ 2,000 for both tickets, but he didn't realize last year when he bought them, it was going to be the same day of his wedding. If you are interested, he is looking for someone to take his place...It's at United Methodist Church @ 3pm. Her name is Charlene, she is 5'6 about 140lbs, good cook too...She'll be the one in the white dress!
A man is nervous about his second date... ...Because of a problem he's been having. Every time he looked at her on their first date he got a raging, obvious erection. He went to his best friend for advice before the second date.

"It's a simple solution, dude. Just grab some gauze and use it to wrap your dick to your leg. That way, the next time you get a boner, it won't even be noticeable"

 The man liked the idea, and went to "prepare" for the date.

The next day, the man went to his friend looking very sullen and embarrassed.

"What happened dude?"

"Well..." He said, "just... listen. So I did what you said just before she arrived, and I felt confident I wouldn't end up tenting for all of the second date. So I when I heard her knock on the door, I just swung it open with all the confidence in the world."

The man's face slowly gets redder. "She was standing at my front door, her makeup was perfect and she had this super tight dress on, dude you should've seen her!"

"Sounds good," said his friend, "but what happened? Did the gauze get loose?"

"No, it's just..." The man looked down in shame. 

"I kicked her in the face."

My Wife and I went to Spain. The other week I went to Barcelona for a vacation with my wife. We stayed at a small local hotel about 30 minutes from the city. The first day we had a great time going around las ramblas and going taking pictures at La Sagrada familia. That night we even attended a Barcelona game against Real Madrid. It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman. I said “I’m amazed that a hotel this small has a full time doctor as skilled as yourself!” She replied “no one expects the Spanish inn physician.”

[Long]Two guys were sitting at a bar at the top of a tall skyscraper. They were both slightly drunk. One of the guys turns to the other and says, “You know, you can jump off this 100 th floor ledge, fall about 50 floors and the winds will pick you up and put you right back on the ledge.”

The other guy says, “Bullshit. Bartender, another.”

The first guy, says “Really! I’ll demonstrate.”

The second guy says, “You’re crazy.”

The first guy says, “c’mon, I’ll show you.” He grabs the skeptic by his sleeve and drags him to the window, opens the window, and climbs out on the ledge. Just as he jumps, the skeptic grabs for him, but he’s too late and the jumper is gone. The skeptic gets nauseous as he watches the jumper fall. But after about 50 floors, the jumper slows down and starts rising. A moment later, he’s sitting on the ledge smiling and says “See?”

The skeptic shakes his head mutters, “Unbelievable.” walks back to the bar and orders another drink.

After a few minutes, the jumper says, “I’ll show you again” and he coaxes the skeptic back to the window. Hops up on the ledge and jumps. After falling about 50 floors, his fall slows and he starts to rise. A few seconds later, he’s back on the window ledge smiling. 

Once again the skeptic shakes his head, walks back to the bar and orders another drink. After finishing the drink, he says, “I’m gonna try that.” The two of them walk over to the window. He hops up onto the ledge, hesitates for a moment then jumps. 

The first guy watches as the jumper falls 100 floors to his death. He smiles, closes the window and walks back to the bar. “Bartender, make it a double.” The bartender pours the drink and hands it over and says, “You know, you can be a real asshole when you’re drunk Superman.”

A CEO goes to heaven... A CEO passes away and goes to heaven. There's a line to get in, but he's not used to waiting in lines and figures this must be a line for all those other people. He bustles on up to the head of the line, but St. Peter sees him and stops him. "Hey, what do you think you're doing?"

"Well, I am - was - CEO of ..."

"That doesn't make any difference up here, we're all equal. Go to the back of the line, unless you have somewhere else to go..."

So he goes to the back of the line, trying to assimilate his newfound status of 'equal', when he sees a man go past him. The man is in a white coat and has a stethoscope around his neck. He bypasses everyone and goes on in.

The former CEO is incensed. He marches up to the front of the line and confronts St. Peter. "How come that doctor got to go in ahead of everyone, if we're all equal here?"

"Oh, that was God. He just thinks he's a doctor."

St. Peter answered, "Those are Lie-Clocks. Everyone who has ever been on earth has a Lie-Clock. Every time you lie, the hands on your clock move."
"Oh", said the man. "Whose clock is that?"
"That's Mother Teresa's", replied St. Peter.
"The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a lie."
"Incredible", said the man.
"And whose clock is that one?"
St. Peter responded, "That's Abraham Lincoln's clock.
The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abraham told only two lies in his entire life."
"Where's Donald Trump's clock?" asked the man.

It was the best KISS hed ever had. A group of HELLS ANGELS, South Carolina bikers were riding east on 378 when they saw a girl about to jump off the Pee Dee River Bridge. So they stopped.
 
George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says,
"Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?"
 
She says tearfully, "I'm going to commit suicide!!"
 
While he didn't want to appear "sensitive," George also didn't want to miss this "be-a-legend" opportunity either so he asked . . . "Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . .
why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?"
 
So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . .
and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.
 
After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, "Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?"

Gambling problem... So this average guy in an average town was at his average job on an average day. Let's call him Average Joe. Joe for short. 

Joe was working away, about 15 minutes from clocking out, and heard a voice in his head that said, "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." Joe just thought he overheard a conversation and continued throughout his day. 

About 2 months later, Joe was at home reading the newspaper after an average day of work, and then again he heard, "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." This time joe seemed to be puzzled as the tv nor the radio was on. But he shrugged it off and continued to read.

About 3 weeks later, Joe was on a date with Average Jill if you will. Jill was ordering a steak medium rare when suddenly, Joe heard the voice again say "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." He asked Jill to be excused, and while in bathroom he rinsed his face with cold water. He was thinking to himself he must be going crazy. But again Joe continued on with his evening. 

It wasn't 3 days before Joe heard the voice again repeat itself about every hour of the day. Then it would become every minute as the day grew dark, and it was starting to drive Joe mad. Joe drank himself to sleep that night. When Joe arose, he headed straight to work, asked his boss for his advance, and then quit immediately . The voices were still constantly repeating "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." He then headed straight to the bank and took out all his savings. After he sold his house to the highest bidder. He loaded up his car with food and clothes, and the $235,000 he had tallied up, and set his TomTom for the nearest airport to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.

The whole trip the voice constantly repeated itself, but as soon as he arrived in Las Vegas, the voice stopped. There was silence, something Joe treasured at the moment. He cracked a smile, but after about 5 solid blissful minutes, the voice began to say, "Go to the nearest casino," over and over again. Felling forced to do so, he headed to the first casino he could find, with his $235k. As soon as he stepped in the casino, he heard the voice say, "Cash in all your money for chips." This strange voice was actually starting to build up confidence in Joe. He thought to himself, if this voice has been in his head and got him this far, then it must know what it's doing. 

His chin was high as he cashed in his entire life into those gorgeous chips in Vegas. Once he had his chips the voice says, "Go to the third roulette table in the back left of the casino." Not even being able to see back that far, Joe listened. Sure enough there were 6 roulette tables exactly where the said, and Joe made his way to third table. The voice then said the instant Joe approached the table, "Put all your money on Red 6." Without hesitation, Joe put his entire life on Red 6, $235k. The roulette table then spun, and then the ball was dropped. It bounced around as the roulette kept spinning, then suddenly it began to lose speed. The ball settled into its hole, but the numbers were too hard to read because of the speed of the spin. Then you hear the dealer call out, "Loser! It landed on Black 13."
Joe was devastated, and then the voice suddenly said in a surprised yet disappointed tone,".....Fuck."

The Horny Rooster Horny Rooster
A farmer wanted to have his hens serviced, so he went to the market looking for a rooster. He was hoping he could get a special rooster - one that would service all of his many hens.
When he told this to the market vendor, the vendor replied, "I have just the rooster for you. Henry here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!"
So the farmer took Henry back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. "Henry", he said, "I'm counting on you to do your stuff." And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house.
Henry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same.
The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, "Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself." But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.
Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.
The farmer walked up to Henry saying, "Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy."
"Shhhhh," Henry whispered, "The buzzard is getting closer."
Zoo A guy learned how to make coffee. Every few weeks, he took a plane to Brazil and made a pilgrimage to the mountains to pick coffee beans with his bare hands, grind them with mortar and pestle, and take them home to make by boiling water manually and pouring it through a strainer.

One day, while in Brazil to get his biweekly coffee beans, he decides that this ordeal is so tiring that he may as well go to the zoo to blow off some steam. While there, he met an otter. He spoke to the otter, and complained about how hard it was to make coffee, and the otter shook his head.

"You don't need a plane ride every few weeks, and you don't have to do it yourself. You can get coffee beans from the store at home." The otter explained.

The man was amazed and returned home and lived life well, a significant and difficult portion of his life made much easier. A few weeks later one of his friends spoke to him.

"I can't take it anymore. I hate flying to Brazil and paying for airfare, and I hate the backbreaking work it takes to pick the coffee beans."

The man shook his head knowingly. "No, no, no." He said brightly, "It doesn't have to be that hard."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I know an otter way."

Cows CSIRO Officials admitted that they found about 200 dead crows on the highway between Noonamah and Palmerston, in Northern Territory, where there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu.

The Territory Government approved and the CSIRO contracted a bird pathologist to examine the remains of all the crows and he confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu, much to everyone’s relief.

However, he determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, and only 2% were killed by car impact. The Territory Government then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine the disproportionate percentages for truck versus car kills.

After 18 months of research and $2.7 million spent, the Ornithological Behaviourist determined the cause in the deaths. When crows eat road kill, they always set-up a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. His conclusion was that the lookout crow could say “Cah”, but he could not say “Truck”.

Edit: Crows not Cows.

Hyena A man using a crutch hops into a bar. As he sat in the bar with one leg hanging, he saw a crowd of people in one corner. He took a peek and saw a hyena just sitting while people tried telling jokes making funny faces but the hyena just sat still with no smile on its face. The man asked the bartender, "excuse me, whats going on in here?". The bartender replied "its a small competition. Anyone who can make the hyena laugh walks away with 25000$".
The man decided to give a try and  withwent a hanging leg he hops toward the hyena and whispered into its ear. The hyena eyes went wide open and started laughing uncontrollably. The man took the money and left the bar while everyone at the bar is left wondering what he said to the hyena. 

One week later the hyena was still laughing and a new competition was held where anyone who can stop the hyena from laughing without harming it wins 50000$.

At a country club tennis court, a man clutches his elbow in pain... He says to his friend, "Geez, my elbow aches. I think I should see a doctor about this".

The friend says, "Well before you do, why don't you try that machine in the locker room. You pee in a cup, and it writes you a prescription!"

Although skeptical, the man agrees to try out the machine. He pees in a cup, puts it into the machine. After some whirring and beeping, it prints out a prescription form. The paper reads, 
"You have tennis elbow. Ice 2x a day and rest it for 2 weeks."
The man is astonished! He immediately races home in excitement.

He thinks to himself that he can trick the machine. He has his wife pee in the cup, then his son, then his daughter. He even has his dog pee in the cup. And for good measure, he decides to put his own semen in.

He drives back to the country club excited to stump the machine. He sticks the cup inside. It whirs and beeps and clunks. After a few minutes, it prints out another prescription form. It reads,

"Your wife is pregnant with another man's baby. Divorce her.

Your son uses heroin. Send him to rehab.

Your daughter has gonorrhea. Get her antibiotics.

Your dog has worms. Take him to the vet.

And if you don't stop jacking off, your tennis elbow will never get better!"

Occasionally he looks at his watch on his wrist
The other is much younger and is wearing threadbare jeans.

After some time, the young man asks, "Excuse me, could you tell me the time?”
The older man says nothing
“Excuse me again, but could you please tell me what time it is?”
The older man looks out the window. Then he looks at the younger man 
and says “No!”
The younger man is quite irritated by this. “Look I asked you a perfectly reasonable question. Why won’t you tell me the time?”
The older man replies, “If I tell you the time we will start a conversation. You will learn things about me. You will find out I have fanciest restaurant in Toledo, that I have a beautiful unmarried daughter. You will come to visit us. You will fall in love with my daughter. You will marry her…”

“Well, would this be so terrible? I am a perfectly respectable young man.”
“Perhaps,” says the older man “But I don’t want a son-in-law who cannot afford a watch.”

A penguin has car trouble.. A penguin is driving along the highway when, suddenly his engine starts running rough and he sees smoke in his rear view mirror. He pulls off the highway and finds the nearest service station, and pulls up to the garage with the car shaking and sputtering. He tells the mechanic what happened, and the mechanic says "OK, give me 10 minutes to check it out."

Meanwhile, the penguin sees an ice cream shop across the street. Thinking this is a perfect time for a tasty treat, he heads over and gets himself an ice cream cone.

After he finishes, he walks back over to the garage, and asks the mechanic "So, did you find out what's wrong?"

The mechanic looks at the penguin and says "It looks like you blew a seal."

The penguin quickly wipes his face and says "Oh, no, that's just the ice cream."

at 1 a.m., the man leaned down and gently woke the woman saying, "ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you, but would you be willing to reach into the closet and get me a second blanket? I'm awfully cold."
"i have a better idea," she replied. "just for tonight, let's pretend that we're married."
"wow! that's a great idea!" he exclaimed.
"good," she replied. "get your own fucking blanket."
after a moment of silence, he farted.
Sven and Olly Sven and Olly have a cow, Margaritte, who stops drinking water and is about to die of dehydration.

In a stroke of genius, the duo grab a hose and take Margaritte to the stream. While Sven holds Margaritte's head in the water, Olly jams the hose into her butt and starts sucking. They figure this will pull the water up through the cow, saving her life.

Olly gets winded pretty quick though and asks Sven to come do the sucking while Olly will hold Margaritte's head underwater.

Sven comes back, grabs the hose, pulls it out of Margaritte, spins it around and puts the end Olly was sucking on into Margaritte, and begins sucking on the other end. 

Olly gasps and says "What are you doing?!"

Sven says "I aint be sticking my lips where you be sticking yours."
A sweet little old lady is doing her weekly shop As she is browsing the aisles she sees a shelf stacker loading the shelves with fresh veg. 
She slowly shuttles over to him and asks politely, "Excuse me sir, have you any cabbage?"
The young fella turns around and sees this old lady and happily obliges and shows her the cabbages. 
The lady sees the cabbages and is blown away by their sizes. "Sir these are far too big. I live alone and couldn't possibly finish this before it goes bad."
"I'm terribly sorry mam, this is all we have."
Looking at him she has a simple solution for him to just cut the head of cabbage in half and she takes half. 
"I'm sorry mam but we can't do this. They have been packaged as a full head and are in the system as such".
The little old lady doesn't take no for an answer and after some few minutes the employee goes to the back where he yells "hey guys. Some asshole wants you to cut this cabbage in half so she can buy it". It's at this point he turns around and sees the old lady had followed him and was standing right behind him, thinking quickly he then proceeds "and this sweet lady will take the other half".

A broom, a dustpan and a vacuum cleaner are hangin at a bar, talking over a few beers. The dustpan looks at the broom and says, "Fuck man, you look all raggedy and dirty, I bet you get noo women!"

A man went on vacation to Thailand once... ...unfortunately something went wrong with the booking of the hotel. His room (and any room for that matter) wouldn't be available until tomorrow. The receptionist told the man that if he asked nicely he might be permitted to stay one night in the local temple along with the monks. So the man made his way to the temple. Once there he was greeted by an old monk. 

"Good evening.. ehm.. sir? Something went wrong when booking my hotel. Could I possibly stay here for just one night?"

"Of course!" said the monk. "We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning. However, I must warn you. You may wake up in the middle of the night hearing a strange sound."

"What strange sound?" the man asked monk, now very curious as to what this might be about.

"I wish I could tell you", said the monk. "But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound."

Although bummed out, the man didn't think much of it. I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was. So when the monk came with his food in the morning he asked him again. 

"I'm sorry", said the monk. "But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound."

"Ok, then I want to become a monk", said the man.

"Becoming a monk is not easy, it requires much dedication and many can't do it."

"I'll do whatever it takes, like, absolutely anything. I NEED to know the source of this sound."

"Very well", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. "To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk."

The man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. 
Many, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. 

"So?"

"I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!" the man said with triumph on his face.

"I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk."

"So... I get to see the source of the sound?"

"Yes, you may. Follow me please."

So he followed the old monk. Through the temple and into a tiny room at the back. The only thing housed in this room was a large wooden door.

"Behind here, is the source of the sound", said the monk.

"FINALLY!" the man thought to himself. "I FINALLY get to see the source of the sound."
He walked up to the large wooden door, filled with anticipation. He placed his hand on the handle and slowly opened the door. 


And what was behind the door? I would tell you, but only monks are allowed to know the source of the sound.

A boy asks his teacher to use the restroom... The teacher says yes and the boy goes. When he goes to wash his hands, he notices the words "Purple Fusion" on the soap dispenser. He gets back to the classroom and asks his teacher what it means. The teacher sends him to the principal. He asks the principal what it means and he expels the boy.

On his way home, the boy almost gets arrested for not being in school. He asks the policeman what "Purple Fusion" means and the policeman just takes off. When the boy gets home he asks his mother what it means. The mom starts crying and orders the boy to ask his father what it means. He then asks his father what it means. His father kicks him out of the house and orders him never to return.

Down the road, the boy suddenly gets hit by a bus. The driver gets out and asks if he is okay. The boy just asks him what "Purple Fusion" means and the boy is then shot by the bus driver.

Now in heaven, the boy asks an angel what "Purple Fusion" means. The boy is sent to hell for "being evil".

In hell, the boy asks Satan what "Purple Fusion" means and Satan sends him back to heaven for "being too evil for Satan".

Back in heaven, the boy asks God what "Purple Fusion" means. God hesitates for a moment and says, "Purple Fusion is a joke with absolutely no punchline that makes everyone mad at you."

The following day he sees an even bigger sausage this time he reaches in and it takes him 3 paws to pull it out almost slipping in and getting wet. Again his family is loving it.

The very next night on the way home a monster of a sausage floating down the stream. It takes all 4 paws to pull it from the water. Of course the cat falls in.

The moral of the story, the bigger the sausage the wetter the pussy!

I remember one day I was at Grandpa's farm and I asked him about sex. He sort of smiled and said,
"Maybe instead of telling you what sex is,
why don't we go out to the horse pasture and I'll show you."
So we did, and there on the ground were my parents having sex. 



What do you call a synthesizer-guitar that's out of tune? A Synthaxe error!!!
An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets... An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets and bars of Soho one sunny afternoon.
 
Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window:
'Pianist wanted for evening performances'.
 
"Fucking get in there you cunt!" he says to himself and goes to the bar.
"Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt", he says to a somewhat startled barman.
The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs.
"Can I help you sir?' he says.
"Yes you can you fucking fat assed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!"
 
The manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.
 
At the end the thrilled barman cries,
"Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?"
"That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' "
"Oh" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, "err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?"
"Fucking wanker..." interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.
 
The manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.
"That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' "
"I see" says the manager. "Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?"
"Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' ".
 
"Look," says the manager, "I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience."
 
"Fuck it", says the pianist, "why cunting not?"
On his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.
 
During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.
 
After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.
"Hi" she says.
"Oh, hello" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.
She leans over and whispers in his ear,
"Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?"
Placing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,
"Know it? I fucking wrote it!!"

The American   doctor laughs: "You all are behind us. Two days ago, we took a man with no brains, no heart, and no liver and made him President.

[Offensive] A Muslim an Atheist and a Hindu get stuck on the side of a road. A nearby farmer decides to let them stay at his house but he only has two beds so he says one of them will have to sleep in the barn.

The Atheist volunteers first and goes to sleep in the barn. However he knocks at the door of the house 15 minutes later and complains that he can't take the smell.

The Hindu offers to take his place because he is used to bad smells from his childhood in India.

However less than 5 minutes later the Hindu knocks at the door of the house and explains he cannot sleep there because there is a cow in the barn and they are too sacred to sleep by in his religion. Finally the Muslim offers to take his place in the barn.

Much to the farmers annoyance there is one more knock at the door and the now very angry farmer is surprised to see his goat in shock at the door.

"I can't sleep in there, man..."

[Long] Vinny comes to America A man named Vinny comes to America from Italy and applies for citizenship. To become an American citizen Vinny has to go to court and stand in front of a judge.

Vinny brings his whole family to the courtroom to cheer him on. They are a very loud and rambunctious Italian family.
Vinny stands in front of the judge and the judge says, "Ok Vinny, before you become an American citizen I have to ask you a few questions about American history"

Vinny very confidently says, "Hey, not a problem judge." As he looks back to his family, he can see that they are all very excited and waiting with eager anticipation.

The judge says "Ok Vinny, who was the first president of the United States?"

Vinny responds, "Oh judge, that's-a easy one... George-a Washington!"

Immediately Vinny's whole family stands up and erupts into applause. You can hear "Hey Vinny!" "That-a boy!" "Way to go!"
The judge puts his hands up "Ok, ok, everybody calm down... Second question, when was the Declaration of Independence signed?"

Vinny confidently pulls on his collar a bit, put his hands out in front of him, and says "Judge, another easy one... 1776!"
Once again his family erupts, making more noise than the last time. "Way to go Vinny!" "That-a boy!"

"Calm down, calm down" says the judge.

At this point Vinny is pretty confident. He is looking back at his family, giving them a couple of "Hey-yo, howya doins" and they are loving it.

It seems as if the judge has lost all control of the courtroom. The family is on their feet and Vinny is in love with himself.

The judge says, "Ok Vinny last question."

"Not-a problem judge" Vinny replies.

The judge kind of smirks, knowing there is no way that Vinny gets this one. He says, "Who assassinated Abraham Lincoln?"

The crowd goes silent.

Vinny is looking around with his head down, clearly very distraught. It becomes very apparent that Vinny will not get the answer to this one.

Vinny nervously grabs his collar and replies, "Hey-a judge... well I-a... I don't know that one."

His family erupts in the biggest uproar of the night. People are now jumping up and down in excitement. It seems as if the clock just his midnight on New Years Day. The judge is banging his gavel, completely confused as to what is going on. Vinny turns to his family and raises his hands high in the air as if he just won a grand prize.

From deep within the crowd you hear a voice shout out with great pride... "That-a boy Vinny! Don't-a squeal on-a nobody!"

Eventually, all of the ammo for their rifles runs out. A private runs up to his general:
"General, we've used all of our ammunition! The only form of defense we have is our fists!"
"Our fists?"
"Yes, sir!"
"Well," said the General, "I have a plan. We'll have all of our troops line up, run collectively up to the enemy, and then, once we approach them, we'll beat them up! They'll never see that coming!"
The private smiles. "That's a great idea, sir!"
"I'll put it into action," the General said. He yelled loudly to all of his troops:
"Okay men, let's set up a punchline!"

Two Black Sharks in a White Pool TL;DR: A story about a Millionaire, his wives and Two Black Sharks in a White Pool.  
&nbsp;  
Once there was this millionaire who was looking for a suitable wife. He was a very handsome man, so he had no trouble finding one that he loved. They fell into a passionate love. He said to his wife on the wedding day “I’m so glad I get to marry the love of my life, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Okay honey, anything for you”.  
&nbsp;  
“You can know anything about me, I’ll tell you” the man said “Just don’t ask me about the two black sharks in the white pool.” His wife thought this was very odd and shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it. As time went on, she became more curious. She developed an obsession with it. One day, she couldn’t stand it anymore and asked her husband “I know you told me not to ask, but I really want to know. What’s with the two black sharks in a white pool?”   
&nbsp;  
The man lost it. He went into a rage and grabbed a chair, beating his wife with it and smacking her into the wall. She snapped her neck as he came to his senses. He quickly cleaned up the mess and buried the body in the back yard.  
&nbsp;  
Distraught, the man spent much of his time inside his house. Eventually he got the courage to go outside and look once more for love. He fell hard for a very attractive model that also admired the young millionaire. On their wedding he was filled with so much joy that he could love again. That night, he said to her. “Honey, I really do love you and I know you love me, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Of course darling, anything for you”.  
&nbsp;  
“You can know anything about me and I’ll be glad to tell you” the man says “Whatever you do, just don’t ask about the two black sharks in the white pool.” His wife was very curious, but because she loved him and decided to drop it. “Okay darling. You don’t have to worry.” But as time went on she became increasingly curious and decided to ask him one night after some vigorous sex. “Darling,” she said “I know you told me not to ask, but what is the deal with the two black shark in a white pool?”  
&nbsp;  
The man became furious in his attack and started to smother her with the pillow. She writhed for a couple of seconds and eventually suffocated. He came to his senses, weeping that he had killed his wife and went to bury her in the back yard.  
&nbsp;  
The man mourned his second wife for a few months, losing all hope in ever finding love again. One day the millionaire got courage to go out drinking with some buddies and met this lovely blonde reporter. They had a great night and went back to his place to have more drinks. Over the next few months they kept seeing each other. The man finally got the courage to propose and they were married within the year.  
&nbsp;  
On their wedding day he was filled with so much joy that he had found someone to love and spend his life with. That evening he said to her. “Oh love, you know that I adore you and I want to be with you, but I have one request.” His wife replied “Anything for you my love”.  
&nbsp;  
“You can know anything about me, nothing is secret” the man said “But do not ask me about the two black sharks in a white pool”. Having been a reporter, his wife had been successful by getting the scoop on just about every good story, but she loved her husband and respected his wish. Each day that passed she grew more curious, as was her instincts as a reporter. She finally got the courage to ask. “My love” she said “I know you don’t want me to ask, but I am very curious! What is with the two black sharks in a white pool?”  
&nbsp;  
The man grabs a knife from the kitchen and goes after his wife, stabbing her to death. He realized that he killed his wife, and wept. He quickly buried her in the back yard. One of his neighbors watched him dragging a body and decided to notify the police.  The police arrived at the house and the man answered “Good evening officers, what can I help you with?”  
&nbsp;  
“Sir we have some information about you and a dead body” one officer says. At this time the neighbor comes over and notifies the police to check the back yard. The police come in and see one freshly dug patch of grass next to a white pool that had two black sharks in it. “What’ve you been digging here?” says the other officer. They call in backup to dig in the backyard of the millionaire and find three dead bodies, after which they detain the man.  
&nbsp;  
In the police station they interrogate the man. “Why do you have three dead bodies in your backyard?” The millionaire was an honest man. In tears he told them about his wives that he’d accidentally killed. “I loved each one of them” says the millionaire “But even when I told them not to, each one of them asked me about the two black sharks in a white pool.”  
&nbsp;  
Confused, the police officer interrogating the man asks “What is with the two black sharks in the white pool? We saw them at your house.” The man becomes enraged and starts to attack the officer. The officer fearing for his life grabs his gun and shoots the man in the head.  
&nbsp;  
To this day nobody knows anything about the two black sharks in a white pool.  
&nbsp;

DirtyKate: Who are you?

Bloodninja: I've got blond hair, blue eyes, I work out a lot

Bloodninja: And I have a part time job delivering for Papa John's in my Geo Storm.

DirtyKate: You sound sexy.. I bet you want me in the back of your car..

Bloodninja: Maybe some other time. You should call up Papa John's and make an order

DirtyKate: Haha! OK

DirtyKate: Hello! I'd like an extra-EXTRA large pizza just dripping with sauce.

Bloodninja: Well, first they would say, "Hello, this is Papa John's, how may I help you", then they tell you the specials, and then you would make your order. So that's an X-Large. What toppings do you want?

DirtyKate: I want everything, baby!

Bloodninja: Is this a delivery?

DirtyKate: Umm...Yes

DirtyKate: So you're bringing the pizza to my house now? Cause I'm home alone... and I think I'll take a shower...

Bloodninja: Good. It will take about fifteen minutes to cook, and then I'll drive to your house.

pause

DirtyKate:I'm almost finished with my shower... Hurry up!

Bloodninja: You can't hurry good pizza.

Bloodninja: I'm on my way now though

pause

DirtyKate: So you're at my front door now.

Bloodninja: How did you know?

Bloodninja: I knock but you can't hear me cause you're in the shower. So I let myself in, and walk inside. I put the pizza down on your coffee table.

Bloodninja: Are you ready to get nasty, baby? I'm as hot as a pizza oven

DirtyKate: ooohh yeah. I step out of the shower and I'm all wet and cold. Warm me up baby

Bloodninja: So you're still in the bathroom?

DirtyKate: Yeah, I'm wrapping a towel around myself.

Bloodninja: I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants with my other hand. As I penetrate the gooey cheese, I moan in ecstacy. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are rough, but the sauce is deliciously soothing. I blow my load in seconds. As you leave the bathroom, I exit through the front door....

DirtyKate: What the fuck?

DirtyKate: You perverted piece of s**t

DirtyKate: F**k

This is a true story: Mmmmmmmaaaaaaaaannnnnnnn! I just left the Mobil (gas station). I pulled up to get some gas and saw two police officers looking at a woman smoking while pumping gas. I'm like really look at this shit! And the police looked like they were thinking the same thing! So I go in to pay for the gas n grab some chips and while I was paying for my stuff I hear someone screaming. I look outside and the lady's arm was on fire! Freaking out! She was tossing and waving her arm around...just going crazy! I ran outside and the cops had put her on the ground. They were putting the fire out with a jacket. I go back in to get my chips(forgot to grab em) and turn to see them handcuffing her. I'm like what in the world is really going on?! So me being the concerned citizen that I am (aka nosey) asked the cops what they were arresting her for; already figuring that catching her arm on fire was punishment enough . Nope! 
One cop looked dead at me and said "FOR WAVING A FIRE ARM"

Two carrots are out for a drive in the country Two carrots are out for a drive in the country. They're having the time of their lives. They're going fast around the curves and letting the wind in their stalks, just loving it. All of a sudden, they get in a pretty horrific crash and are then rushed to the hospital. One of the carrots is ok, just minor cuts and scrapes, but the other is in pretty bad shape and is rushed into the OR.
After hours of operating, the doctor comes out to the other carrot in the waiting room and says, "I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is that your friend is going to live. The bad news is that he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of his life."

"He told me he was going to take me home with him tonight"

He stands up from his stool 

"He told me once he got me home, he was going to throw me on his bed and strip all my clothes off"

He starts to remove his coat, ready to deliver a legendary ass whooping

"He told me once he got me home, stripped me naked and threw me on his bed, he was going to fill my pussy up with whiskey and drink it all out"

The husband stops, puts his coat back on, sits back down, and picks his beer back up and says "Baby I love you, but I am not about to fuck with a man who can drink that much whiskey"

My girlfriend kept asking to be treated like a princess (fixed) So for Valentines day, I surprised her with a fairytale trip to Paris. On the second night we dined at the most beautiful restaurant and after a few drinks I could see the love in her eyes, she was happy, a bit tipsy and giving me that "I'll deal with you later look". Excited, I requested the bill and we rushed to the car. We're messing around in the back seats and just as we're about to reach the end of the tunnel I stop, lock my eyes on hers, she lets out a little gasp as an empty Jack Daniels bottle rolls out from under the driver seat. The chauffeur is hammered, we're spinning out of control and smash into a bridge support killing us all instantly.

A farmer named Clyde had a car accident. In court, the trucking company's lawyer was questioning Clyde. "Didn't you say, at the moment of the accident, 'I'm fine.'" asked the lawyer?

Clyde responded, "Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite mule, Bessie, into the..."

"I did not ask you for any details", the lawyer interrupted. "Just answer the question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine?'"

Clyde said, "Well, I had  just got Bessie into the trailer and I was driving  down the road." 

The lawyer interrupted again and said "Judge, I'm trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question."

By this time the judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer "I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule, Bessie."

Clyde thanked the judge and proceeded.

"Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side.  I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.

When the highway patrolman came on the scene he could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her and saw her near fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.

Then the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me and said, 'how are you feeling?'

Now what the fuck would you say?"

Putin begins, saying "Russian submarines are best in the world! They can stay submerged for weeks at a time before needing supplies."

Trump laughs, "Oh no no, AMERICAN submarines are the best in the world. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it! They can go for months without needing supplies!"

Prince Charles and the hooker... Prince Charles and the Hooker: 4 years ago Prince Charles decided to take up walking every day. At the same street corner he passed a hooker standing there every day. He learned to brace himself as he approached her for what was almost certain to follow. “One hundred and fifty pounds!” she’d shout. “No! Five pounds!” He said from the side of His mouth, just to shut her up. This ritual between him and the hooker became a daily occurrence. She’d yell, “One hundred and Fifty pounds!” He’d yell back, “Five pounds!” One day, Camilla decided to accompany her ‘husband’. As the couple neared the hooker’s corner, Prince Charles realised she’d bark her £150 offer and Camilla would wonder what he’d really been doing on all his past outings. He figured he’d better have a good explanation for his Wife As they neared the hooker’s corner he became even more apprehensive than usual. Sure enough, there she stood. He tried to avoid eye contact as she watched the pair pass. Then, the hooker yelled: “See what you get for five pounds, you tight bastard!”......😂

A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down... The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu. 

"I'm sorry, sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer. I'll smell it and order from there." 

A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. 

He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him. 

The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. 

"Ah, yes, that's what I'll have -- meatloaf and mashed potatoes." 

Unbelievable, the owner thinks as he walks towards the kitchen. 

The cook happens to be the owner's wife.

He tells her what had just happened. 

The blind man eats his meal and leaves. 

Several days later, the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again. 

"Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man." 

"I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork." 

The owner retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. 

After another deep breath, the blind man says, "That smells great. I'll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli." 

Walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him. 

The blind man eats and leaves. 

He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen. 

He tells his wife, "Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man." 

Mary complies and hands her husband the fork. 

As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. 

"Good afternoon, sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you." 

The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff, and says, "Hey I didn't know that Mary worked here..."

I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend with big tits When I was 13, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend with big tits.

When I was 16, I got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life.
In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional.
Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.
When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring.
She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. 
Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.

When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn’t keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

I am older and wiser now, and I am looking for a girl with big tits.

Chuck is on the last day of his tour in Vietnam... ...and he decides to celebrate. He goes into the city, gets very drunk, and sleeps with a Vietnamese hooker. A few days later, back in the states, he wakes up to find that his dick is covered in purple spots. So he goes to the doctor.

"I'm sorry, son," the doctor says, "but you've contracted a rare venereal disease. It's not very common in this part of the world. We don't know that much about it, and unfortunately the only definite cure is to amputate."

"Amputate my penis?" Chuck asks in disbelief.

"Yes I'm afraid so."

Chuck stands up. "I'm sorry, doc, but I just can't believe that's the only solution. I'm getting a second opinion."

So Chuck decides to fly back to Vietnam, in hopes that the local doctors will know more about the rare disease. He finds a doctor, and makes an appointment.

"Oh yes," the Vietnamese doctor says. "We see all the time, very common here. You no worry."

"Thank goodness! The American doctor wanted to amputate my dick!"

The Vietnamese doctor laughed. "Crazy American doctors! They always want to amputate something! Make more money that way. Wait two weeks, dick fall off by itself!"

It's raining as a drunk man stumbles up to a bus stop... It's raining as a drunk man stumbles up to a bus stop, and starts talking with a very well dressed sober man already standing there. As they chat, the dapper fellow sees a beautiful blonde woman holding an umbrella about to walk past. As she passes, the dapper fellow says to her "tickle your ass with a feather?" to which the blonde says with startled anger "what did you just say to me‽". The man responds "particularly nasty weather". The blonde looks relieved, apologies profusely, and continues on her way.
This is very amusing to the drunk and through slurred speech he requests that his new friend do it again, to which the fellow obliges. 
They spot a gorgeous redhead about to stroll past, and the dapper fellow says to her "tickle your ass with a feather?" Infuriated, the redhead demands to know if he kisses his mother with that mouth, and demands that he repeat himself. The man says "particularly nasty weather!" The redhead demurs, apologizes, and continues on her way. The drunk has never been so amused, and requests that he try it himself.
The dapper fellow approves, and the drunk proceeds to stagger over to a stunning brunette passing by and loudly barks "hey baby, ya want me to put a feather in your ass‽"
She immediately proceeds to slap him as hard as she can, and without missing a beat, the drunk then says "hey, I think it's raining!"

A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun..... A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun in the front seat. 
The hippie looks over and asks the nun if she would have sex with him.
The nun, surprised by the question, politely declines and gets off at the next stop. 
When the bus starts again, the bus driver says to the hippie, "If you want, 
I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you."
The hippie of course says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that 
every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. 
"If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder," says the bus driver, "You 
could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you."
The hippie decides to try this out. That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. 
Right on schedule, the nun shows up. While she's in the middle of praying, the hippie walks out 
from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. "I am God, I have heard your prayers and 
I will answer them but you must have sex with me first," he says.
The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. 
The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about having sex with the nun.
After the hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, "Ha ha, I'm the hippie! "
The nun replies by whipping off her mask and shouting, "Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!"

Three couples walk into a church... One is an elderly pair, the second pair a little younger and finally the third a couple of newlyweds. They meet with the pastor, a strict but amicable looking man. The three couples tell the pastor they want to join his congregation. 

He gives them a big grin and replies, "Of course you may, but all of our new members must first pass a single test. If you can successfully abstain from sex for two weeks, we will welcome you with open arms." 

Sure enough, they all agree to follow the pastor's instructions and leave. Two weeks later they're all back at the church. 

The pastor first asks the elderly couple how it went. The husband replies, "Eh, it wasn't too hard.    At our age, sex is more of an accident." The pastor tells them they're welcome to his congregation. 

He then turns to the younger couple and asks them the same question. The husband replies, "The first week was easy. The second.. Well I had to sleep on the couch, but we made it." The pastor welcomes them to the church, too. 

Finally, he turns to the young couple and asks them about their two weeks. The husband replies, "Well, we were doing fine, honest, until she reached up a high shelf to grab a can of red paint. She was wearing this really short skirt and I couldn't very well control myself. We did it then and there." 

The pastor solemnly shakes his head. "I am truly sorry but I can't let you into my congregation." 

The newlywed husband says, "That's quite alright, father, for all its worth, I don't think they'll let us back into the Home Depot either."

"Welcome to hell, Hitler." He says. "You deserve a place here for your actions. I will show you 3 rooms, and you'll have to switch places with the person inside the room. Now, follow me please."

Hitler stays silent and follows Satan. They walk into a corridor with 3 doors. Satan opens the first door. Inside, there's a fully burnt figure laying on the floor, constantly being burnt over and over by sunrays.

"Would you like to switch places?" Satan asks.

"Um... Nein, show me ze other options." Hitler responds. They walk on to the next room. Satan opens the door, revealing a man being crushed by a boulder over and over as he screams in agony with each impact.

"Would you like to switch places?" Satan asks.

"Nein. Show me ze last room." Hitler responds. Satan leads him to the last room, revealing a fat guy sitting on a chair, getting a blowjob from Kate Upton. 

Without even Satan asking, Hitler grins and says "Ya, I want zis room!" He claims in excitment, thinking about the pleasures awaiting him.

Satan smiles. "Great choice, Mr. Adolf." He then turns his head to them. "Hey Kate, we found your substitute!"

The tyrannical CEO Initech was a world shipping conglomerate. Its CEO was a real tyrant. He was abusive to all of his subordinates and would even bully members of the board to get his way. He once chewed out a Senior Vice President because he didn't like the color of the VP's tie. He once fired a division director for using the wrong cover for his quarterly TPS report.  And he liked to assert his superiority in calling last minute, mandatory, all-hands-required meetings.

When the staff heard that there was one of these meetings coming up, he knew that there would be trouble. And sure enough, when the CEO arrived (five minutes late), he went straight into a tirade about… flying alligators.

After he finished the room went silent. The CEO turned red.

> I don't believe that you have all understood the gravity of this situation.

Facing the COO he shouted, 

> Dave, why aren't you concerned about this‽ You mean to tell me that you don't believe in flying alligators‽

Dave replied,

> I do sir, it's just, they fly really, really low.

The one on bottom says, "The hell you are!"
Ignoring the bottom number, the top one goes and puts his name in. This angers the bottom number, and he undoes the nomination. He then comes back to the numerator and tells him what he did.
"Why'd you do that!?" He replied, angrily.
"It's my job," replied the denominator.

If you give a man a fish… …He’ll eat for a day; teach the man to fish he eats for a lifetime.

…he may choke on the bones and die. Think of the liability, and the guilt!!

…you don’t know if he’s allergic. Again, you need to think of the liabilities!!

…He’ll keep eating your fish; stop giving the man fish, let him fetch his own.

…that’s worth nothing to him; he can’t figure how to fish then he surely can’t cook for shit

…He’ll eat for a day; if you teach the man to fish he’ll buy a boat and start fishing. He’ll start his own fishing company; soon he’ll have a whole fleet and a booming business. One day you will be buying your own fish from him.

…but he should be eating more vegetables instead

…God know what kind of fetishes he has…

The following day she was being interviewed by a local TV station, and the commentator asked about what it felt to be married again at that age and would she share part of her previous experiences, since it seem quite unique the fact that her new husband was a ‘funeral director.’ After a short time to think, a smile came to her face and she proudly explained that she had first married a banker when she was in her twenties, in her forties she married a circus ring master, and in her sixties she married a pastor and now in her eighties, a funeral director. The amazed commentator asked her why she had married men with such diverse Careers. With a smile on her face she explained, ‘I married one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four to go.’

A cowboy from Texas A cowboy, who just moved to Wyoming from Texas, walks into a bar and orders three mugs of Bud.

He sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn.

When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.

The bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, "You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time..."

The cowboy replies, "Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is an Airborne Ranger, the other is a Navy Seal, both serving overseas somewhere.

When we all left our home in Texas, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together.

So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself."

The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.

The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way.

He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.

One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs.

All the regulars take notice and fall silent.

When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss."

The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.

"Oh, no, everybody's just fine," he explains, "It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking."

"Hasn't affected my brothers though...."

Boy: "£750." 
Man: "Fine."

A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball!" 
The boy says, "I can't. I sold them." 
The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?" 
The son says, "£1,000." 
The father says, "That's terrible to over-charge your friends like that. That is way more than those two 
things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess."

They go to church and the father alerts the priest and makes the little boy sit in the confession booth 
and closes the door.
The boy says, "Dark in here." 
The priest says, "Don't start that sh*t again."

I asked him what it was and he said 'It's a toy Yoda'.

A professor has a leaky sink A math professor has a leaky sink, and calls a plumber to fix it. The plumber fixes the sink quickly, but discovers a few other problems which also need to be fixed. The plumber is done after about 2 hours, and gives the professor the bill. The professor realizes that the plumber gets paid much more than he does. Having watched the plumber fixing the pipes, he thought it didn't look to difficult and that becoming a plumber might earn more money than being a professor.

"I'm sorry to bother you, but is your employer hiring?" Asked the professor.

"Yes, they are," replied the plumber, "but there is one thing you must know before you apply."

"And what might that be?"

"They don't like educated people very much, so if you want to get the job you will need to lie and say you only have a 6th grade education."

The professor followed his advice, and got a job as a plumber. He quit his job at the University. Everything went well for him, and he had worked as a plumber for 6 months when the company decided that all their plumbers should have at least a 7th grade education. They were enrolled in night classes.

On the first day, everything went well. Being an educated person, the professor already knew all the curriculum, but he made sure to put in a wrong answer here and there so nobody would find out.

On the second day, everything went smoothly as well, until the instructor asked the professor for the formula for the area of a circle. As he walked to the front of the room, his mind went totally blank. He could not remember the formula, no matter how hard he tried. 

He frantically wrote equations and formulas on the blackboard, trying to find the formula he needed. He found something after several minutes of frantic scribbling, but alas, it was incorrect. He felt defeated, knowing his secret would be revealed and he hadn't even gotten the question right.

The plumbers quietly talked among themselves. The professor thought about what insults they might be coming up with, and what would happen to him now that they knew he was educated. They talked for a minute, before, apparently at a conclusion, one plumber stood up. The professor steeled himself for an insult, as the plumber began to speak:

"Try reversing the bounds on the integral"

Airplane Etiquette A nice and neatly dressed man is sitting on an airplane next to a woman. 

An hour into the flight, he pulls out a filthy men's magazine and starts to read it. 

After a little while longer he removes his hat. Then he takes off his leather gloves. Then he unzips his pants and pulls them down and removes his underwear and proceeds to give himself a "hand job" until he climaxes. 

Afterwards, he puts away the magazine, puts his pants back on, zips them up, and puts his gloves and hat back on until he is completely dressed again.

The lady sitting next to him has been watching the whole thing and notices the man taking out a cigarette. 

He turns to her and asks, "you wouldn't be offended if I smoke, would you?"

The teacher nodded, and then she called on little Susie. 

Little Susie said, "I would want platinum because platinum is worth more than gold and I could buy a Porsche." 

The teacher smiled, and then she called on Little Johnny.

The teacher said, "Silicone? Why silicone, Little Johnny?"

"Are you my daddy?" A woman is all ready to give birth to her first baby. 

The doctor, obstetrician, and nurses are all waiting for the birth. 

The doc checks for any signs of progress and suddenly he feels something moving, pulls back his hand and this little head pops out, sees the doc and asks him, 

"Are you my daddy?" 

"No, I'm not," the doctor replies. 

The head pops back in. 

Then the obstetrician goes over to check out the situation. The baby pops out his head and asks him, 

"Are you my daddy?"

"Nope, I didn't do it," and the baby pops back in.
 
The doctor calls the father and says, "Sir, the baby seems to be reluctant to come out---he keeps asking for his father. Would you please come to the delivery room?" 

So the father is standing there and the baby pops his head out again, and seeing his father the little one asks in an annoyed voice, 

"Are YOU my daddy?"

Dad kneels down and answers proudly, "Yes, son, I am your lucky father!" 

The baby starts tapping his index finger violently and repeatedly on his father's forehead and asks, 

"This is pretty annoying, isn't it?"

I know everyone is tired of the negativity with all the recent events... I'm negative too. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I just can't comprehend how this guy is so successful. How did he win? And to be on the biggest stage in the world now. It doesn't make sense. No one ever thought he was a real contender, but here he is.

With all the scandal, how people think his wins are illegitimate because of tampering, how he'll need an asterisk next to his name in the history books, etc. what are we supposed to think?

It is surreal: his goofy haircuts, his weird sense of style, his cockiness, his supermodel trophy wife, his ridiculous popularity with some people (yet I don't know anyone around me who likes him). 

The media gives him so much attention, in a weird love/hate relationship. Some already say he's the greatest ever. How do you ignore it?

I don't care what anyone says, I'm rooting for him to fail.

A little girl goes to her father... (long) "Dad, where do we come from?"
 
 
The father replies, "Well, a long time ago, God decided that he would create Adam, and then a wife for him Eve, to live here on earth. He allowed them to live here and have children and we come from them."
 
  
The girl, seemingly perplexed, then goes to her mother. "Mom, where do we come from?"
 

The mother says, " Well, I guess you're not too young for this, a long time ago, there were a species of apes that evolved over generations, and one of the successful evolution happened when the apes slowly became human, and we are descendant from that line of apes."
 

The girl, now fuming, goes back to her father, "DAD! why did you lie to me? Mom said that we evolved from apes!"
 

The father, "Oh, I see the confusion. Let me clarify, **MY** family is descendant from Adam and Eve. Your **MOTHER's** family is descendant from apes."
