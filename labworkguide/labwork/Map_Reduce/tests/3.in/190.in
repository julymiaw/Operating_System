The Mute Child The little kid never said a word, never uttered a syllable his entire life. Parents took him to doctor after doctor - each doctor said "I have no idea why he can't talk, I can't find any reason for him to remain silent". So the parents finally gave up and accepted their boy couldn't speak and as time passed their son got older. The boy had turned twelve and one morning at the breakfast table he suddenly said in a loud voice "**these pancakes taste like shit**. Well, his mom was shocked and dropped the dishes she had in hand. She looked at him and exclaimed "Little Bobby - YOU CAN TALK?!?!", and the boy replied "yeah". She was quiet for a moment as the realization sunk in, and then asked "well, why haven't you said anything your whole life up until now?".
