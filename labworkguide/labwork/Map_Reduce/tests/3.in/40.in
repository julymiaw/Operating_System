Valentine's Day Gift 
A young lady was caught napping one afternoon on Valentine's Day. She woke up when she heard the doorbell.

"I just dreamed that you gave me a pearl necklace for Valentine's day," she said to her boyfriend. "What do you think it means?"

"You'll know for sure tonight," he replied.

That evening, the young man arrived with a small package and gave it to his girlfriend. Delighted, she opened it and found a book entitled "The meaning of dreams." 
A guy walks into a restaurant orders a steamy soup After a while, the waiter comes back with the soup.
The guy tastes the soup and frowns at the waiter.
"Excuse me, i asked for a steamy soup, and that my friend, is not a steamy soup.
The waiter apologizes and tells him that he'll take care of that. 

The waiter comes back with the soup. The bowl is now boiling hot, and he uses towels to grab it.
The guy tastes the soup, spits it right out, and yelling at the waiter:
"What is so difficult to understand?! I want a steamy soup! I don't want it hot, i want a STEAMY FUCKING SOUP!!! 

...

After being heated for a long time in the highest temperature possible, and cooked in a maximum heating stove, the steamy soup is finally ready.
The waiter needs 5 towels on each side only to grab the bowl.
The bowl is carried on a maximum heated plate.
The whole restaurant becomes a sauna, and steams covers the entire place.

The sweaty waiter serves the soup to the guy.
The guys tastes the soup, and the waiter tensely looking at him.
The guy thinks for a while and than saying: "now this is what i call a steamy soup! Thank you very much!"
-"Your'e welcome!", says the waiter, and calmly returns to do his duties.

After the guy finishes the soup, a man approaching to him and says:
"Hey there, sorry to bother you, but i sat at the table over there and i couldn't help but looking at you! I have to ask you something!
-"Sure!", says the guy.
-"You are a pilot, right?"
-"Well yeah! How did you know?!"
-"I can tell by your uniform..."
