Have you heard about the magic dildo? One day a business man had to go on a long trip for work and decided that before his trip he would buy a "special present" for his wife while he was away. 

On his way home, the man went to an adult store and asked the worker if their were any new items that would keep his wife busy while he was away. 

The worker pointed to the latest and greatest "magic dildo". He told the business man "all you need to do is tell it where you want it to go and it will magically go there". 

The business man couldn't believe it so the worker said "magic dildo to the door!" The dildo jumped out of its box and flew to the door. The business man was so excited that he bought a boxed dildo right then and there. 

When he got home he was so excited and told his wife about the new present he bought her. She didn't love the idea but a few days later she was feeling lonely and pulled out the box to her magic dildo. 

She said "magic dildo to my vagina!" The dildo jumped out of the box and started pleasuring her. After finishing the wife tried pulling the dildo out but it wouldn't budge. 

She got really worried and her calls wouldn't go through to her husband so, she started driving to the hospital. On her way the dildo continued pleasuring her and with each orgasm she swerved her car. 

Soon after swerving, a cop pulled her over and asked why she was swerving. She told the cop the whole story about the magic dildo and how she couldn't get it out of her. 

The cop laughed and said "magic dildo my ass!"

A Newlywed Couple A newlywed couple moves into their new house. One day the husband comes home from work and his wife says, "Honey, you know, in the upstairs bathroom one of the pipes is leaking, could you fix it?" The husband says, "What do I look like, Mr. Plumber?" 

A few days go by, and he comes home from work and his wife says, "Honey, the car won't start. I think it needs a new battery. Could you change it for me?" He says: "What do I look like, Mr. Goodwrench?" 

Another few days go by, and it's raining pretty hard. The wife finds a leak in the roof. She says, "Honey, there's a leak on the roof! Can you please fix it?" He says, "What do I look like, Bob Vila?" 

The next day the husband comes home, and the roof is fixed. So is the plumbing and the car. He asks his wife what happened. "Oh, I had a handyman come in and fix them," she says. "Great! How much is that going to cost me?" he snarls. Wife says: "Nothing." He said he'd do it for free if I either baked him a cake or slept with him."

"Uh, well, what kind of cake did you make?" asks the husband. 

"What do I look like," she says, "Betty Crocker?"
