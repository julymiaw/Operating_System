What's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with boobs? One is a crusty bus station, and the other is a busty crustacean. 
Why is your nose in the middle of your face? Because it is the scenter!

A poem. I am a little girl,

I have a little thing

That when I go to bed,

I put my finger in.

Now I'm much older,

My thing had lost its charm

And now it takes 5 fingers,

And half my fucking arm.
So I bought a new chair today Guess you can say I'm SATisfied.
