10 Inch Bic Two Men were out fishing when one decides to have a smoke 
He asks the other guy if he has a lighter 
He replies "Yes I do!" and hands the other a 10 inch long cigarette lighter 
Surprised the guy asks "Where did you get this?" The guy replies "Oh I have a personal genie." 
The first man asks "Can I make a wish? " 
Sure says the other man "Just make sure that you speak clearly cause he is a little hard of hearing" "Ok I will" says the other as he rubs the lamp a genie appears and asks the man what he wants The man says " I want a Million Bucks " 
The genie says OK and goes back to his bottle and 10 seconds later a million ducks fly over head And the guy says to the other " 
Your genie realy sucks at hearing doesnt he?" 

The other man replies

 "I know, do you really think I asked for a 10 inch BIC?"
