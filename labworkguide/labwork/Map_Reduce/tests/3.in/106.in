Friend asked to use my phone to call his mom.. Told him to just hit redial.
John, Ted and Dave went to have an adventure in the Amazon Jungle... ...unfortunately, they we're captured by a local cannibal tribe. 

The tribe leader gave them each a chance to live and be escorted out of the forest with one condition, they have to pass the tribe leader's trial: To go find a fruit and go back with it.

John was the first one to come back and brought an apple with him. The leader then instructed that the fruit be inserted up John's ass for 5 seconds without him having any facial reactions. 3 seconds in and he let out a huge painful cry. The leader signaled his men to behead John and so they did.

Ted was next and brought a blueberry with him, he was instructed to do the exact same thing that John did. A split second remaining for the countdown to finish when Ted laughed uncontrollably, letting out tears. He was beheaded almost instantly.

In the afterlife, John asked why Ted did what he did when he was surely about to be spared by his life. Ted answered, "Dave was coming back carrying a fucking huge jackfruit, what the hell am i supposed to do?"

I'll see myself out...
A group of Boy Scouts and their leader were walking through a forest one day. They found their campsite and began to pitch their tents. There were ten boys, and each one had a tent. Once they were finished, they lit a campfire. They roasted marshmallows over the fire and sang songs until it was very late into the night. Each boy went into his own tent and into his own sleeping bag. At about two o'clock in the morning, there was a rustle in the bushes. The boys and their leader all woke up. Each one got out of his sleeping bag and then out of his tent to see what was making the noise. Once outside, the Boy Scouts found a large purple spotted monster with ten arms. The boys tried to run away, but each of the purple spotted monster's arms caught one boy. The monster quickly devoured all the scouts it had caught. The Boy Scout leader watched in horror because there was nothing he could do. He ran away as quickly as he could. He ran through the forest and all the way back to the Boy Scout base. When he got there, he was completely out of breath. The other leaders looked at him and asked what was wrong.

"Well, we set up camp as usual. Then, in the middle of the night, we heard a rustle. When we got out of our tents to see what it was, we found a purple spotted monster. The monster had ten arms and caught all ten boys. It gobbled them all up and there was nothing I could do"

"You must be lying. Tell us where the scouts really are."

"I'm not lying: that was the whole troop and nothing but the troop."
