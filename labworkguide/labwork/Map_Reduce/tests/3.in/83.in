The Toothpaste Salesman So a toothpaste company offered a promotion to the salesman who could sell the most toothpaste in one week. 

After one week they all came back and the boss asked how they did. 

The first said he sold 100 by going door to door and telling people about the toothpaste, the boss says wow that's good. 

The second said he sold 1000 by standing in front of grocery stories and tell people how important toothpaste is, and the boss says wow that's amazing.  

The third said I sold 50,000 and the boss asked how that is possible, the salesman then says he went to the local [insert local professional sports arena] NFL game and set up a sign that says FREE CHIPS AND DIP, and when the people tasted the dip they said "wow that dip taste like shit" and the salesman responded by saying "it is, would you like to buy a toothbrush?" 
An American walks into a cheesemaker's shop in Italy. The cheesemaker greets him with an enthusiastic smile, "*Ciao!* How-a may I help-a you-a?"

The American asks, "Do you have any Gouda cheese?"

The cheesemaker scowls and turns red in the face, then gesticulates around the room and yells, "It's-a all-a good-a cheese!!"
