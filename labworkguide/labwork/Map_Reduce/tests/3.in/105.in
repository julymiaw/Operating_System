In the beginning, God created the dog. He told it, "For 20 years, you are to sit near the door and bark at whoever walks by."

The dog responded, "20 years? That's a long time to do that. How about I do that for 10 years and give you back the remainder?"

God agreed. He then created the monkey and told it, "For 20 years, you are to entertain and bring joy to others."

The monkey replied, "20 years is a long time to do that. What if I do it for 10 years and give you back the rest of the time?"

God agreed. He proceeded to create the cow to which He told, "For 40 years, you are to slave and provide others with milk and labor."

The cow protested, "That's a long time to do that. What if I do half and give you back the remainder?"

God agreed. He finally created man and said to him, "For 25 years, you are to eat, sleep, marry, and have fun."

Man asks, "Only 25 years? That's not nearly enough time. Couldn't you give me the remainder of the time that the animals gave back?"

God agreed. That is why now after marriage, we spend 20 years slaving and providing for our family, 10 years entertaining our grandchildren, and 10 more years sitting near the door and barking at whoever walks by.

This joke is ironic. This joke is not ironic.

Isn't that ironic?
People need to learn to live in the moment, because the here and now is a special gift. Thatâ€™s why I call it the present.
Why are black people so loud? Because they think we can't hear them  ;)
