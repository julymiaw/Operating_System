When life gives you lemons... why do you use a bra?
Napping at work Sometimes, when I'm sure people can only see the back of my head, I enjoy sneaking in a quick catnap at work. They never last too long though, invariably someone rings the bell telling me they want to get off my bus.
Two vampire bats were hanging arround Suddenlly the first one states: "I'm hungry, I'm going to grab a bite to eat" and he flies off.

Half an hour later he returns with a huge smile on his face and blood on his chin.

The other bat asks: "Did you get your fill?"

"Oh boy did i ever. Do you see that red roofed barn way over there?"

"Ahha"

"Well beyond that barn there is a huge herde of cows... an all you can eat bufette"

So the second bat gets excited and flies off.

45 minutes latter he returnes with a gloom expression and a face full of blood. "Do you see that big church tower over there?" He asks his friend.

"Yeah, I see it"

"Well I sure as hell didn't"
