A farmer is milking his cow This is a translation of a Galician joke, feel free to correct any mistake/awkward phrasing 


A farmer is milking his cow, the cow whips him with her tail. -Fuckin' cow! The farmer keeps milking the cow, and the cow keeps whipping him. At the third whip, the farmer is really pissed with the cow, so he gets a stool, takes his belt off and ties the cow tail to the ceiling -Not so smart now, aren't you? His pants fall to the floor, and in that exact moment, his wife enters the cowhouse.

+Manolo! What the hell! 

-Look, if I tell you the truth you would not believe me anyway, so yea, I'm going to fuck this cow.
