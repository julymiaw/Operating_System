I saw an old school friend today and he started bragging about his well paid job, his flash expensive car and his enormous house.


Then he took a photo out of his wallet, showed it to me and said. "That's my wife, isn't she beautiful"?


I looked it at and said "If you think she's beautiful, you should see my wife"


He said "Why, is she a stunner?‚Äù


I said "No, she's a fucking optometrist!"

The mate looked surprised and replied, "You mean that you've never heard of ... an aye for an aye?"
