He kindly agrees and the next day he shows up at 1 pm with 100$.  He hands her the money and they proceed to have at each other, in every conceivable way, for several hours.  After the deed is done, he leaves the house.

"Did he happen to give you 100$?", he replies promptly.

Her heart sinks, "Y-y-yes, he did."

"Ah, ok.  Good.  He came by earlier and asked to borrow 100$.  He said he'd drop it off at the house today at 1 pm"
