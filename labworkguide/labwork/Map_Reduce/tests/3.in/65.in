My boss told me, "You are the worst train driver ever. How many have you derailed this year?" I replied, "I don't know; it's hard to keep track".
Did you hear about the musician who named his daughter Sharp? He didn't have the heart to tell her she was accidental.

The executive is overworked and decide to take some time off and visit his farmer cousins... The executive is overworked getting stressed and decide to take some time off from work and visit his cousins who live in a farm in the country side.
He calls his cousin who is more than happy to have him over since they haven't seen each other in years.
When the executive gets there he notices that not much has changed since the last time he was there, a long time ago. He is filled with nostalgia and starts feeling better already.
They have coffee and chat for a little bit and the executive says he wants to do some farm manual labor to take his head off work and forget about the city life for a while.
The farmer says there is plenty of work to do around the farm and the executive can help him. So the farmer tells him to wake up early the next day and meet him at the stable.
When the executive gets to the stable the next day the farmer shows him piles of bags and say:
- This is all the horse manure we collected for the past 3 months. Your job will will be to spread it over that empty field to fertilize the soil for the next season.
Two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do.
The farmer is surprised. "This usually takes us a whole day! I only planned work for you for tomorrow".
So the farmer inspects the field and is astonished the executive did such a good job in so little time. So he tells him to take the rest of the day off and meet him at he chicken coop the next morning.
The next morning the farmer says: "We got a big chicken order from one of our clients and we have to deliver it ready for processing. Your job will be to cut the chickens head off so we can send them out. Again, two hours later the executive is done and goes to ask his cousin what else he can do. The farmer is surprised now even more. He didn't think his city cousin could manage farm jobs so well.
"This usually takes us two days, this is impressive! Meet me at the orange plantation tomorrow morning."
The next morning the farmer says: "The orange harvesting wasn't very good this year. We only got this 10 boxes of oranges. Your job will be to separate them in 3 piles, big oranges, medium oranges and small oranges. If anyone is bad just discard it."
To the farmers surprise, it's the end of the day and his executive cousin is still not back for dinner, so he goes to check on him. When he gets there is sees his cousin working out still on the first box, comparing sizes on two oranges, then picking a third one and changing it's original pile... The farmer is puzzled, screeching his head. "what's the matter? I thought you would finish this in no time"
The executive looks at him and says: "I'm an executive. We are really good at spreading shit and cutting heads. But we really struggle when it comes to making decisions"
