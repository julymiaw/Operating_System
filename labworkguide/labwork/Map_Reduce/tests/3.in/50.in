A priest.... A priest, an Irishman, a horse, a gorilla, a twelve inch pianist and an infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar.

Steve and his buddies were hanging out and..... Steve and his buddies were hanging out and planning an upcoming fishing trip. 
Unfortunately, he had to tell them that he couldn't go this time because his wife wouldn't let him. 
After a lot of teasing and name calling, Steve headed home frustrated.

The following week when Steve's buddies arrived at the lake to set up camp, they were shocked to see Steve. 
He was already sitting at the campground with a cold beer, swag rolled out, 
fishing rod in hand, and a camp fire glowing.
"How did you talk your missus into letting you go Steve?"

"Yesterday, when I left work, I went home and slumped down in my chair with a beer to drown my 
sorrows because I couldn't go fishing. Then the ol' lady Snuck up behind me and covered my eyes and said, 
'Surprise'. When I peeled her hands back, she was standing there in a beautiful see through negligee and 
she said, 'Carry me into the bedroom, tie me to the bed and you can do whatever you want,' So, Here I am!"
