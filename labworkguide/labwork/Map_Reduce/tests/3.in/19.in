What do you call a teenage Hitler Zitler
So a man walks into a bar... ... and he goes straight to the bartender. He orders a grasshopper and a screwdriver, and pays with a $100 bill. 


The bartender, not thinking much of it, simply gives the man his drinks and his change. The man then drinks both of the beverages.


The man then spots a good friend across the bar, and notices that his friend is with a woman that looked nothing like the friend's wife. The man confronts his friend when he is alone, and the friend says


"Actually, that's my sister. She's visiting town from Pittsburgh."


The friend then pulls out his phone and proves this with some family photos and their last few text conversations. The man, realizing he misunderstood the situation, apologizes to his friend and his sibling and walks out of the bar, wishing both of them a good night.


The man walks down the street when he watches two people dressed as apes, three women dressed as clowns, and two kids in a tandem horse costume. The man knows it is Halloween, so this succession of people doesn't phase him or anyone else on the sidewalk.


The man reaches his house and, noting that the lights are off, quietly unlocks the door so as to not wake up his sleeping wife. He slowly tiptoes his way up the stairs when he misses a step and stumbles down three stairs. This wakes up his wife, and she walks out of their bedroom and says


"Are you okay sweetie?"


"Yeah," the man says, "I just stumbled a bit. Sorry I'm late, I ran across Jim at the bar and we had a chat."



"It's alright, honey. Just get to bed soon, okay? I need you to get Billy to his friend's birthday party tomorrow."


"Okay, sweetest." Said the man. He doesn't really want to do it, since it means he has to talk with the other kids' parents while he's there, and the man isn't very good at small talk.



But he loves his son, so he will do it anyway. The man undresses and lays down on the bed, content with the day he had.
