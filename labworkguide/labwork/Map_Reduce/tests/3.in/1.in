What is Politics? A little boy goes to his dad and asks, "What is politics?"

 Dad says, "Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I’m the breadwinner of the family, so let’s call me capitalism. 
Your Mom, she’s the administrator of the money, so we’ll call her the Government. 
We’re here to take care of your needs, so we’ll call you the people. 
The nanny, we’ll consider her the Working Class. 
And your baby brother, we’ll call him the Future. 
Now, think about that and see if that makes sense," 

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents’ room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny’s room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. 

The next morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I Understand the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about." The little boy replies, "Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit."
A teacher asked her students... A teacher asked her 4th grade students a question every Thursday afternoon at the end of the day saying if they got it right they would not need to come to school Friday.

The first week she asks "how many stars in the galaxy?" No students had the answer.

The next week she asks"how many grains of sand are there on the beaches in Florida?" Nobody had an answer. 

The kids were getting frustrated, and little Billy told them "don't worry, I have an idea."

Billy came to school Thursday with 2 billiard balls that were painted black. As the teacher stands up to ask her question at the end of the day, Billy rolls the balls down towards the front of the room.

The billiard balls crash against her desk and the students laugh. The teacher shouts "ok! Who is the comedian with the black balls!?"

Billy jumps from his seat, strolls toward the door and says "Kevin Hart. See you on Monday!"
I bought a Fleetwood Mac GPS for my car. 
It's useless though. It just keeps telling me to go my own way.
A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, “Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?”
The man below says: “Yes. You’re in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field.”
“You must work in Information Technology,” says the balloonist.
“I do” replies the man. “How did you know?”
“Well,” says the balloonist, “everything you have told me is technically correct, but It’s of no use to anyone.”
The man below replies, “You must work in management.”
“I do,” replies the balloonist, “But how’d you know?”*
“Well”, says the man, “you don’t know where you are or where you’re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You’re in the same position you were before we met, but now it’s my fault.”
