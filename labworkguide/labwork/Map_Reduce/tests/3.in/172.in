A Pair of Slippers and A Dildo Two guys are sitting around talking about what they got their wives for Valentines Day

Todd : "So, what did you get your wife for Valentines day?"

Mark : "I got her this BEAUTIFUL diamond ring. She shows this thing off wherever she goes. She wears it to the store, out to get the mail, to the gas station, etc. She loves it man. What about you?"

Todd : "Well, I got my wife a pair of slippers and a dildo..."

Mark : "What the fuck? That's rather odd for Valentines day don't ya think?"

Todd : "Actually, it makes perfect sense. If she doesn't like the slippers, then she can go fuck herself"
