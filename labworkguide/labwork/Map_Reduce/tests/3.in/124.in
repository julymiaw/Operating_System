A woman walks into a voodoo market... She walks up to an old man selling cursed items where she proceeds to say "I would like to buy a magic mirror for my cheating boyfriend so he can break it and have 7 years of bad luck." The old man reaches into his drawer and pulls out a condom. He says "if he's cheating, then 7 years isn't enough. If he breaks this, he will get 18."
Over the last few weeks i've been collecting details about my life and adding them to spreadsheet on my computer. I've really exelled myself.
We used to have Reagan, Jonny Cash and Bob Hope Now we have Trump, no cash, and no hope.
