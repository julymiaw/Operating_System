Jesus is setting up for supper and he calls Judas over to help. "Judas, please set the table. " Judas complies and sets the table. "Judas, put the food on the table." Judas places the food on the table.  "Judas, please call everyone to the table. " Again, he does as he is told and gathers everyone. 

As they are enjoying the feast Jesus planned and had Judas serve, Jesus gets really serious and says," This will be my last supper with you." He pauses and continues, " One of you will betray me." 
At which point Judas throws his hands up in a huff," Why do I have to do everything around here?!"
