A man goes to the doctor The doctor says, "What's wrong with you?"

The man replies, "Doctor, there's a lot of things wrong, please look me over."

The doctor agrees and starts his examination. He's only barely begun and when he tries to look in the man's ear, he exclaims, "my God man, there's a piece of lettuce in there!"

The man sighs and says, "I know Doc, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. "

"Daddy, what do dogs say when they are happy to see another dog?"   

Father, annoyed responds "woof woof woof. Stop asking so many questions, we're working"  

The little boy is distracted for a moment when he says "Daddy, what does mommy say when she is happy to see you?" Father doesn't immediately respond. The little boy, perturbed yells, "DADDY!!"  

Father is startled and bangs his head on the engine, beginning to bleed, he screams "Oh god, fuck me!" Bob scrambles for a towel.  

The little boy says, "Silly, Daddy, that's what mommy says when she talks to Bob in her room while you're at work, I asked what she says when she's happy to see you."
