My friend told me to try out a gloryhole, since you can pretend it's a woman on the other side I've sucked 5 dicks so far and I still have no idea how this is supposed to work
I prayed to god to end violence on earth. He responded to my ticket saying "You shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server"
A Young guy from Nebraska A young guy from Nebraska moves to Florida and goes to a big "everything under one roof" department store looking for a job.
The Manager says, "Do you have any sales experience?" The kid says, "Yeah. I was a salesman back in Omaha." Well, the boss liked the kid and gave him the job. "You start tomorrow." I'll come down after we close and see how you did."
His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the boss came down. "How many customers bought something from you today? The kid says, "One".
The boss says, "Just one? Our sales people average 20 to 30 customers a day. How much was the sale for?" The kid says, "$101,237.65 ". The boss says, "$101,237.65? What the heck did you sell?"
The kid says, "First, I sold him a small fish hook. Then I sold him a medium fishhook. Then I sold him a larger fishhook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Boston Whaler. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 Expedition."
The boss said, "A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a BOAT and a TRUCK?"
The kid said, "No, the guy came in here to buy Tampons for his wife, and I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot, you should go fishing.'"
A man farted every morning when he woke up. His wife got very annoyed and disgusted by this, so she made a plan to get him to stop. One day after the man farted, she said "honey, you know if you keep forcing those farts every morning your guts will slip right out." You see, the wife was a butcher. That night she took some pig's guts home from the shop in a cooler and stuffed them in the man's pants while he was sleeping. The next morning the wife woke up and her husband was in the bathroom for the next 2 hours. He comes out and the wife asks what he had been doing in there. The man replied "You were right about my guts dear, but with the help of God and my own two fingers I managed to get them back up there!"
The only person in my life that told me to smile... Was the camera man.
