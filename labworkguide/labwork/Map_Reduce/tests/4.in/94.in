A priest and a bus driver are waiting at the gates of Heaven... Heard this joke whilst on holiday in Norway, I thought it was worth sharing.


In a rural mountainous village, both a local bus driver and a priest are waiting at the gates of heaven. Saint Peter arrives, and firsts asks the priest why he should be allowed into heaven. "I've been teaching the ideas of Christianity for 50 years, I think I deserve to be in heaven after devoting my life to Christ." St Peter then turns to the bus driver: "Well, I've been transporting people up and down the mountains for 50 years, I think I deserve to be in heaven as I've helped everyone dearly"


St Peter thinks, then allows the bus driver to walk through but not the priest. Outraged, the priest asks: "Why was I not allowed in but the bus driver was!?" St Peter replies: "Your lectures were boring, everyone was falling asleep and not paying respect to God! However, when the bus was driving up and down mountains, everyone was alert and saying their prayers!"

A man walks into church and sits in the confessional booth. The priest sits down and the man says, "Forgive me for I have sinned. I was golfing yesterday and I cursed."

The priest replies, "Would you like to tell me what happened?"

"Well," the guy says. "I was out on the seventh hole, and I'd just hit my best drive of the day. Straight ahead, down the middle of the fairway, and a long way down. I was feeling pretty good about myself as I walked to the ball. I wasn't 30 feet away when a squirrel ran out of the trees and grabbed my ball."

The priest interrupts, "Oh, I see. So that's when you cursed?"

The man replies, "No Father, I didn't. As the squirrel was running away, it got to the end of the fairway when it was caught by a hawk, which flew high into the air."

Once again, he priest interrupts, "So that's when you cursed?"

The man continues, "No Father. The hawk started flying away, and I followed it, because it flew in the direction of the green. As it passed over the green, it squeezed the squirrel with its talons, causing the ball to drop about three feet from the pin."

The priest says, "Don't tell me you missed the fucking putt!"

A guy at a bar says to the bartender, "Hey jackass! Get me a beer." The bartender turns around, stares at the guy for a second, and proceeds to serve him a beer. 

The bartender walks to the other end of the bar, and another guy says "Hey, come on man. Don't let that jerk treat you that way." The bartender just shrugs and quietly walks away. 

A few minutes later, once again, the guy shouts "Hey jackass! Get me another beer!" 
Of course, the bartender obliges and serves him a beer. 

The other guy says "Look man, you can't let that guy do that to you. Stand up for yourself! Do you hear what he's calling you?" 

This time, the bartender replies, "Oh, that guy? HEE-HAW HEE-HAW HE ALWAYS calls me that!"
