Confensual sex A couple had been married for 40 years, and decided for their anniversary they would go to the same spot they went on their honeymoon those 40 years ago. It was a nice little spot by a farm, with rolling hills visible in the distance.

As they strolled down a path next to the cows, the husband smacked his wife on the behind and said "You know honey, 40 years ago we had sex right here, up against this fence. You remember?"

She replied "Yes, I do remember. We sure were something back then, werent we?"

He answered "Indeed. How about we do it again for old time's sake?"

With that, they proceeded to have sex up against the same fence that they done it against as newlyweds.

When finished, the old man exclaimed "Wow honey, you really had a good time, didnt you? You havent moved that much in a long time, in fact, I dont even know if you moved that much when we had sex here 40 years ago!"

She said "Well, 40 years ago that fence wasnt electrified."

A man thought his wife was losing her hearing A man thought his wife was losing her hearing. He was going to the doctor for a check up one day, so he decided to ask the doctor for advice while he was there. He said to the doctor, "Doc, I think my wife is hard of hearing. Sometimes when I ask her questions she can't hear me. What should I do?" The doctor replied, "Here's what you need to do. Tonight while your wife is making dinner in the kitchen, go into the bedroom and ask her what's for dinner. If she doesn't hear you, go into the living room and ask again. If she doesn't hear you while you're in the living room, go into the dining room and ask a third time. If she still can't hear you even from the dining room, go into the kitchen and ask one more time. If she can't hear you while you're in the kitchen, then she must be losing her hearing."

So the man took the doctor's advice and tested it out on his wife that night. First, he went into the bedroom and called out to his wife, "Honey, what's for dinner?" No response. So he moved into the living room. He called out again, "Honey, what's for dinner?" No response. So he moved again, this time into the dining room. "Honey what's for dinner?" Still no response. So finally, he moved into the kitchen where his wife was making dinner and asked once more, "Honey, what's for dinner?" His wife turned to look at him with an angry look on her face and said, "Chicken. I told you three times, dumbass."
