A Matchmaker walks into a bar... They see 5 people in there, 2 pair of couples and a stag.  One of the couple is a Gothic couple and a Nerdy Couple.


The Matchmaker talks to the Gothic couple and says to the couple "You're gonna laid tonight."


The Gothic couple replies "How would you know that?"


The Matchmakers states that its because they feel that are emotionally strong for each other.


The Matchmaker then goes to the nerdy couple and says "You're gonna get laid tonight."


The nerdy couple ask "Why?"


The Matchmaker says its because they are mentally strong for each other.


Finally the Matchmaker goes to the stag and says "You're gonna get laid tonight."


The man replies "Really?  How do you know?"


The matchmaker replies "Because I am physically stronger than you."
