Apparently this was one of the jokes from East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. A citizen orders a Trabant car. The salesman tells him to come back to pick it up in nine years. The customer asks: "Shall I come back in the morning or in the evening then?" 
 
"You're joking, aren't you?" 

 "No, not at all. It's just that I need to know whether the plumber can come at 3pm or not."

So one day they had a party and I was invited, so I stopped by and finally asked, "Where did Ant Eater get that nick name". With out a pause Ant Eaters brother said "Oh because he slept with our Aunt, and apparently he was good with his tongue. So we call him Aunt Eater!"
