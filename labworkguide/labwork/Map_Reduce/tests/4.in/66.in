I saw an old school friend today and he started bragging about his well paid job, his flash expensive car and his enormous house.


Then he took a photo out of his wallet, showed it to me and said. "That's my wife, isn't she beautiful"?

The mate looked surprised and replied, "You mean that you've never heard of ... an aye for an aye?"

The two boys went to the community and did their work and returned to court the following month.

The judge asked the first boy how he did and he told the judge that he convinced 30 people not to do drugs.

The judge said, "That was great how did you do that?"

The Boy told him, "I used a diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this: O o and told them this (the big circle) is your brain before drugs and this (small circle) is your brain after drugs."
