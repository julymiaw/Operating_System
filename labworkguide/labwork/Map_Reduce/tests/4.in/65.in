Vladislav There was once a man named Vladislav. He worked an average job, received minimum wage, and was frustrated with his life. 
One day he received a call from his wife, who told him out of guilt that she had been cheating on him for several months now, and wanted to stop by the house to collect her belongings before she left him.
Upon reaching home, the wife saw Vlad sitting on a couch, staring at the wall. 

"Vladislav..." 

He looks at her and says with an unmoving expression:

"Baby, don't hurt me."

During WW2 a British pilot is captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp. While there he developes an infection in his leg and the camp doctor tells him that they have to amputate.

"I have a request," says the pilot, "could you please cremate the limb and sprinkle the ashes over my beloved home land the next time your boys do a flyover?"

"We can do that." says the doctor. He makes the arrangements and the ashes are delivered.

The pilot gets another infection, this time in his arm. The doctor tells him they need to amputate. 

"I have a request," says the pilot, "could you please cremate the limb and sprinkle the ashes over my beloved home land the next time your boys do a flyover?"

"We can do that." says the doctor. He makes the arrangements and the ashes are delivered

A few weeks go by and the pilot gets another infection, this time in his remaining leg. The doctor tells him that they need to amputate.

"I have a request," says the pilot, "could you please cremate the limb and sprinkle the ashes over my beloved home land-"

"STOP!" bellows a prison guard, "He's trying to escape!"
