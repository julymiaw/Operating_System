My apologies. Two punjabi neighbours are arguing over whose fence is better. One says, "Your fence isn't even waterproof. You didn't picket correctly". The other slaps the first. Enraged the first shouts, "How dare you. What gave you the right to slap me."  The second neighbour replies, "It's not my right, it's my state. It's my Pun-job".

A woman gives birth to twins An old fisherman and his wife settle down and decide to have some kids. The wife ends up giving birth to twins, both boys. Eventually as the babies grow the couple notice that the two never face the same way. Wherever one of them looks the other is always facing the opposite direction, no matter what they do. The couple decide to name them Toward and Away.

The kids grow and have a happy childhood despite this strange behavior and when they turn 10 years old their father decides he wants to teach them to learn how to be fishermen like him. He teaches them all the tools of the trade, the right knots to tie, the proper way to care for the equipment, how to steer the boat and catch the wind in the sails, and all the other ins and outs of the trade.

One day the three head out on a fishing trip together. The mother kisses them goodbye, wishes them well, and watches as they sail off. Three week.s go by before the father, and only the father, returns, looking haggard and gaunt.

"What on Earth happened?!" exclaims the wife upon his return. "You were gone for so long that I had almost given up hope. Where are our sons?"

"My dear," says the man, "I'm afraid they are dead. I only barely survived myself."

"What happened to you?" asks the wife.

"Well, the day we set sail we found a great school of fish and were catching many large fish to bring home. Suddenly an enormous fish, bigger than the boat, lept out of the water and capsized us with the wave that came from it. We were flung into the water where we clung to driftwood to stay afloat. As we tried to get back together the fish breached again, swallowing Toward in its great jaws."

"Oh, my, that's terrible!"

"It is, but you should have seen the one that got Away!"
