In the beginning, God created the dog. He told it, "For 20 years, you are to sit near the door and bark at whoever walks by."

The dog responded, "20 years? That's a long time to do that. How about I do that for 10 years and give you back the remainder?"

God agreed. He then created the monkey and told it, "For 20 years, you are to entertain and bring joy to others."

The monkey replied, "20 years is a long time to do that. What if I do it for 10 years and give you back the rest of the time?"

God agreed. He proceeded to create the cow to which He told, "For 40 years, you are to slave and provide others with milk and labor."

The cow protested, "That's a long time to do that. What if I do half and give you back the remainder?"

God agreed. He finally created man and said to him, "For 25 years, you are to eat, sleep, marry, and have fun."

Man asks, "Only 25 years? That's not nearly enough time. Couldn't you give me the remainder of the time that the animals gave back?"

God agreed. That is why now after marriage, we spend 20 years slaving and providing for our family, 10 years entertaining our grandchildren, and 10 more years sitting near the door and barking at whoever walks by.

This joke is ironic. This joke is not ironic.

Isn't that ironic?
People need to learn to live in the moment, because the here and now is a special gift. Thatâ€™s why I call it the present.
Why are black people so loud? Because they think we can't hear them  ;)

John, Ted and Dave went to have an adventure in the Amazon Jungle... ...unfortunately, they we're captured by a local cannibal tribe. 

The tribe leader gave them each a chance to live and be escorted out of the forest with one condition, they have to pass the tribe leader's trial: To go find a fruit and go back with it.

John was the first one to come back and brought an apple with him. The leader then instructed that the fruit be inserted up John's ass for 5 seconds without him having any facial reactions. 3 seconds in and he let out a huge painful cry. The leader signaled his men to behead John and so they did.

Ted was next and brought a blueberry with him, he was instructed to do the exact same thing that John did. A split second remaining for the countdown to finish when Ted laughed uncontrollably, letting out tears. He was beheaded almost instantly.

In the afterlife, John asked why Ted did what he did when he was surely about to be spared by his life. Ted answered, "Dave was coming back carrying a fucking huge jackfruit, what the hell am i supposed to do?"

I'll see myself out...
A group of Boy Scouts and their leader were walking through a forest one day. They found their campsite and began to pitch their tents. There were ten boys, and each one had a tent. Once they were finished, they lit a campfire. They roasted marshmallows over the fire and sang songs until it was very late into the night. Each boy went into his own tent and into his own sleeping bag. At about two o'clock in the morning, there was a rustle in the bushes. The boys and their leader all woke up. Each one got out of his sleeping bag and then out of his tent to see what was making the noise. Once outside, the Boy Scouts found a large purple spotted monster with ten arms. The boys tried to run away, but each of the purple spotted monster's arms caught one boy. The monster quickly devoured all the scouts it had caught. The Boy Scout leader watched in horror because there was nothing he could do. He ran away as quickly as he could. He ran through the forest and all the way back to the Boy Scout base. When he got there, he was completely out of breath. The other leaders looked at him and asked what was wrong.

"Well, we set up camp as usual. Then, in the middle of the night, we heard a rustle. When we got out of our tents to see what it was, we found a purple spotted monster. The monster had ten arms and caught all ten boys. It gobbled them all up and there was nothing I could do"

"You must be lying. Tell us where the scouts really are."

"I'm not lying: that was the whole troop and nothing but the troop."
