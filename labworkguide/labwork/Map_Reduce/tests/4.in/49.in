taxi A taxi passenger tapped the driver on the shoulder to ask him a question.

The driver screamed, lost control of the car, nearly hit a bus, went up on the sidewalk, and stopped inches from a shop window.

For a second, everything went quiet in the cab, then the driver said, "Look friend, don't ever do that again. You scared the daylights out of me!"

The passenger apologized and said he didn't realize that a little tap could scare him so much.

The driver replied, "Sorry, it's not really your fault. Today is my first day as a cab driver - I've been driving a hearse for the last 25 years."
Blind man During summer there was a day that was so hot it was almost unbearable. 

In an old church, with no fans or air conditioning there was two nuns and a priest. The nuns clothing was making them so hot since it was not very breathable material. 

So they decided to go to the priest and ask, "Father, can we please remove these clothes! It is just too hot and we can not take it anymore!", to which the priest replied, "Absolutely not! It is forbidden to be nude around others as a nun!". The nuns were very disheartened, and were becoming emotional. The priest see's this and as he is a kind man he offers a compromise, "You may remove your clothing but as long as you stay in your rooms, lock the doors, and allow no one in with your clothes off!".

The nuns were extremely happy with this and ran off to their rooms as quickly as possible, and undressed. A couple hours later, one of the nuns hears a knock on the door, **knock** **knock** **knock**. She is surprised since there is supposed to be no one around besides the other none and priest. She calls out "Who is it? What do you want?", a mans voice replies with "Its the blind man." The nun is very relieved as she does not have to get dressed since the man is blind and can not obviously see her with no clothes on. So she opens the door and greets the man, "Hi sir, what can I help you with?" and the man replies with "Nice tits sister, now where can I put these blinds?"
