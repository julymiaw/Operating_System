My dad always lived by the motto "Work hard, play hard." Mom made him seek help for his Viagra addiction.
Jesus is setting up for supper and he calls Judas over to help. "Judas, please set the table. " Judas complies and sets the table. "Judas, put the food on the table." Judas places the food on the table.  "Judas, please call everyone to the table. " Again, he does as he is told and gathers everyone. 

As they are enjoying the feast Jesus planned and had Judas serve, Jesus gets really serious and says," This will be my last supper with you." He pauses and continues, " One of you will betray me." 
At which point Judas throws his hands up in a huff," Why do I have to do everything around here?!"

Adultery Code There was this old priest who got sick of all the people in his parish who kept confessing to adultery. One Sunday, in the pulpit, he said, "If I hear one more person confess to adultery, I'll quit!" Well, everyone liked him, so they came up with a code word. Someone who had committed adultery would say they had "fallen". 

This seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well, until the priest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priest arrived, he visited the Mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. 

The priest said, "You have to do something about the sidewalks in town. When people come into the confessional, they keep talking about having fallen." 

The Mayor started to laugh, realizing that no-one had told the new priest about the code word. 

Before the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said, "I don't know what you're laughing about. Your wife fell three times this week."
