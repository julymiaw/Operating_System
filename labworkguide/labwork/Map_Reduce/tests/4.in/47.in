Three guys were sitting in a bar talking. One was a Doctor, one was a Lawyer, and one was a Biker. After a sip of his martini, the doctor said; "You know, tomorrow is 
my anniversary. I got my wife a diamond ring and a new Mercedez. I 
figure that if she doesn't like the diamond ring, she will at least
like the Mercedez, and she will know that I love her."

After finishing his scotch, the lawyer replied; "Well, on my last 
anniversary, I got my wife a string of pearls and a trip to the 
Bahamas. I figured if she didn't like the pearls, she would at least
like the trip, and she would know that I love her."


The Biker then took a big swig from his beer, and said; "Yah, well 
for my anniversary, I got my old lady a tee-shirt and a vibrator. I
figured if she didn't like the tee-shirt, she could go fuck herself."

Me in a nutshell: Agh! What the Hell! Why am I in a nutshell!
Three missionaries in Africa Three missionaries are going to evangelize tribes in the deep jungle, where they heard dangerous tribes exist.  
What had to happen happened, and they got caught by a warriors tribe. Everybody is killed except the missionaries and one native interpreter.  
The tribe chief tells the first missionary:  
"You have been considered by the mighty tribe of Koungata. Now you have to choose: Tounga, or death.  
- Well, said the missionary, I don't know Tounga but anything is better than death! I choose Tounga.  
- Very well! Tounga it is, then."  
Then three huge warriors approach, bend the missionary over and have their way with him, brutally. The screams can be heard for a full hour.
Then it's the turn of the second missionary, who is deathly pale but still choose Tounga, and gets pounded by three new huge warriors.  
When it's the turn of the third missionary, he just can't take it and says:  
" I can't, this is too much, I'd rather die a martyr than suffer such indignity! I choose death!  
- Very well, answers the chief, you chose death. You will have death, by Tounga ! 

I too believe more women should be in Government. That's why I support Betsy DeVos.
