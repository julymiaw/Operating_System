It's a Priests first day at a new church... and after Mass he sits down in the confession booth. He's nervous because this is his first time in confessional after seminary school and he isn't sure if he'll remember what to do.

Someone walks in and sits down, and starts to confess. "Forgive me Father for I have sinned, it's been 2 weeks since my last confession."

Father thinks for a second, and says, "Alright my son, you get 10 Hail Marys and you shall be forgiven"

Second person comes in, sits down and starts to confess. "Forgive me Father for I have sinned. I slept with a woman who was not my wife."

Father panics a little, settles down and starts to think. "Ah, yes! I give you 20 Our Fathers and you shall be forgiven my son."

A third person comes in and sits down. "Forgive me father, but last night I got a blowjob." 

"Oh, no!" he though, "what do I do!"

So Father quickly peeks outside and grabs an Alter Boy and says, "hey what do you get for a blowjob??"

And the Alter Boy says, "well the old Priest used to give me a snickers"
